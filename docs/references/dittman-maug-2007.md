 Lower Salaries and No Options? On the Optimal

 Structure of Executive Pay

 INGOLF DITTMANN and ERNST MAUG*

 ABSTRACT

 We calibrate the standard principal-agent model with constant relative risk aversion
 and lognormal stock prices to a sample of 598 U.S. CEOs. We show that this model pre-
 dicts that most CEOs should not hold any stock options. Instead, CEOs should have
 lower base salaries and receive additional shares in their companies; many would be
 required to purchase additional stock in their companies. These contracts would re-
 duce average compensation costs by 20% while providing the same incentives and the
 same utility to CEOs. We conclude that the standard principal-agent model typically
 used in the literature cannot rationalize observed contracts.

 We don't give options because it would be a lottery ticket.

 There will be no new stock option grants from Microsoft. Instead, we will
 award actual stock to our employees.

 THIS PAPER ANALYZES THE OPTIMAL STRUCTURE OF CEO PAY, or, more specifically, the
 optimal balance among stock, options, and base salary in executive compen-
 sation contracts. We develop a new methodology to estimate and test efficient
 contracting models and apply it to a model of efficient contracting that is widely
 used in the literature on executive compensation. Assuming constant relative
 risk aversion and lognormally distributed stock prices, we determine optimal
 contracts for a sample of CEOs and conclude that the model cannot generate ob-
 served contracts. In particular, it rarely predicts options. We explore a number
 of alternative modeling approaches but none are convincing. We conclude that

 we need a different contracting model to understand salient features of execu-
 tive compensation contracts. Our results are also consistent with the view that
 observed compensation practice suffers from significant defects and therefore
 cannot be explained by an efficient contracting model.

 The literature on the structure of executive compensation contracts offers
 two complementary perspectives on executive stock options.' One perspective
 highlights the fact that stock options are "expensive" because they are risky
 (e.g., Oyer and Schaefer (2005)). For instance, for typical parameter values, an
 option that is worth $100 to diversified investors may be worth only $20 to $40
 to an undiversified, risk-averse CEO. This perspective emphasizes the partici-
 pation constraint of the CEO, but it neglects incentives. The other perspective
 suggests that stock options are "cheap" because they provide more incentives
 for the same dollar outlay as an equivalent investment in stock, enabling com-
 panies to save on compensation costs associated with providing incentives (e.g.,
 Hall and Murphy (2000)). This perspective focuses only on the incentive com-
 patibility constraint. We bring these two perspectives together in the context of
 a complete contracting model and argue that their relative importance depends
 on whether the model also features downward constraints on fixed salaries.

 To illustrate this point, consider a simple numerical example. Suppose a com-
 pany can provide the same incentives (and therefore induce the same action by
 the CEO) with either one share with a market value of $100 and a subjective
 value (certainty equivalent) of $40, or with options with a market value of $95
 and a subjective value of $25.

 Stock Options

 Market value $100 $95
 - Subjective value $40 $25

 = Risk premium $60 $70

 If base salaries are rigid, then only market values are relevant and options

 are always a cheaper way to provide the same incentives. In this example, the
 company saves $5 (=$100 - $95) by using options. If the CEO's base salary
 is variable, however, then stock dominates options. In this case, the company
 incurs additional compensation costs of $70 if incentives are provided through
 options (award options worth $95, reduce base salary by $25); the same in-
 centives cost the company only $60 if incentives are provided with stock. We
 argue that the situation described in this numerical example is the empirically
 relevant one.

 We calibrate a principal-agent model of efficient contracting that has become
 standard in the literature on executive compensation contracts, especially in

 1 Despite the long list of references at the end of this paper, we make no attempt to survey
 the large literature on executive stock options, let alone the still larger literature on executive
 compensation. Excellent surveys on various aspects of the subject include Abowd and Kaplan
 (1999), Murphy (1999), Prendergast (1999), Core, Guay, and Larcker (2003), and Hall and Murphy
 (2003).

 quantitative analyses of the design features of these contracts. The model com-
 bines preferences with constant relative risk aversion (CRRA) and lognormally
 distributed prices. Applications of this model to executive compensation date
 back at least to Lambert, Larcker, and Verrecchia (1991).2 Alternative models,
 such as those that use preferences with constant absolute risk aversion or nor-
 mally distributed prices, are seldom used. If they are used, they are employed
 mostly to generate qualitative results and closed-form solutions, rarely to es-
 timate, calibrate, or simulate models or to obtain quantifiable results.3 Hence,
 our modeling approach implements a variant of the "conventional" model.

 We develop a new methodology to apply and test this model. First, we refor-
 mulate the model so that it can be calibrated to an individual CEO with publicly
 available data. We then estimate the relevant model parameters for a sample
 of 598 CEOs. In particular, we aggregate option holdings into a representative
 option and estimate wealth from the CEO's previous years' income. For risk
 aversion we use a grid of values that cover the range that other researchers
 suggest as plausible. Next, we numerically determine the optimal contract for
 each level of risk aversion and each CEO in our data set. Finally, we compare
 the optimal contracts implied by the model with the actual contracts we observe
 and evaluate whether they are statistically and economically different.

 Our main result is that the model cannot account for a prominent feature of
 96% of the contracts in our sample: We almost never obtain stock options as part
 of an optimal contract. While on average the CEOs in our sample hold options
 on 1.3% of their companies, the model cannot account for more than 0.1% of
 these holdings, even for very low levels of risk aversion, and predicts that most
 CEOs should not have any stock options at all. An immediate implication is
 that CEOs should also receive lower base salaries and more restricted stock.
 Indeed, for a typical level of risk aversion, 47% of the CEOs in our sample
 should receive no base salary at all, but rather should use some of their private
 savings to purchase additional stock in their companies. The efficiency gains
 implied by the model are economically significant. We find that contracts that
 provide the same level of expected utility and the same incentives to the CEO
 would be cheaper by 20%, or $12.3 million, on average.

 We investigate some generalizations of this setup and allow for more gen-
 eral contracts. First, we drop the constraint that option holdings must be

 2 CRRA preferences and lognormal prices have been used by Lambert et al. (1991), Hall and
 Murphy (2000, 2002), Himmelberg and Hubbard (2000), Hall and Knox (2004), Jenter (2002),
 and Oyer and Schaefer (2003). Closely related are models that combine CRRA-preferences with
 geometric binomial trees, or geometric Brownian motion models of stock price development that
 generate identical or similar distributions of stock prices. Binomial models are used by Huddart
 (1994) and Carpenter (1998), and Brownian motion models by Tian (2001), Johnson and Tian
 (2000a, 2000b), and Ingersoll (2002).

 3 Feltham and Wu (2001) and Baker and Hall (2004) use CARA normal models. Nohel and
 Todd (2005) use CRRA preferences with a uniform distribution, Henderson (2005) uses CARA
 preferences with geometric Brownian motions, and Carpenter (2000) uses hyperbolic absolute risk
 aversion (HARA). Hemmer et al. (2000) use HARA utility and a Gamma distribution in an analytic
 model. Haubrich and Popova (1998) is one of the few studies that uses CARA preferences in a
 calibration exercise. They also use a discrete state space model. Lambert and Larcker (2004) use
 CRRA preferences with a truncated normal distribution of stock prices.

 nonnegative. It turns out that this constraint is binding in almost all cases. Op-
 timal unconstrained contracts have negative option holdings but much higher
 stock holdings than both optimal constrained contracts and observed contracts.
 As a result, the pay-for-performance sensitivities of unconstrained contracts
 are generally positive but small for higher stock prices. In order to benchmark
 our results we also calibrate the general nonlinear contract that is theoreti-
 cally optimal. This shows that the conventional (CRRA-lognormal) model im-
 plies concave contracts that emphasize "sticks" over "carrots": The penalties
 for stock price decreases are large, whereas the additional pay for stock price
 increases is small. By comparison, observed contracts emphasize carrots, fea-
 turing large gains for stock price increases but protecting the CEO against large
 losses. In principle, while the general nonlinear contract could be implemented
 by firing the CEO for significant underperformance, observed contributions of
 CEO-turnover to pay-for-performance sensitivity are much smaller than those
 implied by the contracts found by the conventional model.4

 A number of papers argue that options are awarded to provide risk-taking
 incentives, so that the CEO is willing to adopt projects that increase value
 and risk.5 We analyze whether the optimal contracts implied by our model
 change the CEO's risk tolerance relative to observed contracts. We find that the
 optimal contract with nonnegative option holdings only slightly reduces risk-
 taking incentives. This effect appears too weak to explain the option holdings
 in observed contracts.

 We recompute all our results for a model that incorporates personal and cor-
 porate taxes. We document the tax advantage of options, but this aspect does not
 change our main results. We also check for possibly incorrect measurements of
 wealth and contract convexity, as well as for alternative distributional assump-
 tions. We find that our analysis is robust to errors along these three dimensions.
 Similarly, we argue that hedging by the CEO through trading in the stock mar-
 ket is unlikely to change our results. We conclude that neither the standard
 version nor several variants of the principal-agent model can accommodate
 stock options, and thus this model is ill-suited to analyze design features of
 stock option contracts.6,7

 We can reconcile the model with observed contracts by assuming that base

 salaries cannot be adjusted downward, just as suggested by the example above.

 4 The literature on CEO turnover goes back at least to Coughlan and Schmidt (1985). See also
 Kaplan (1994). Brickley (2003) summarizes the subsequent discussion by arguing that the economic
 significance of CEO turnover is small.

 5 This argument goes back to Smith and Stulz (1985). We discuss the literature on this topic in

 greater detail below.

 6 Several design features have been analyzed in the literature. Hemmer, Matsunaga, and Shevlin
 (1998) and Huddart, Jagannathan, and Saly (1999) discuss reloading. Meulbroek (2001) models
 indexing of strike prices, and Hall and Murphy (2000) analyze optimal strike prices. The valuation
 model of Sircar and Xiong (2003) allows for resetting as well as reloading.

 7 Core et al. (2003) also recognize this limitation of existing research in their survey. Oyer and
 Schaefer (2005) reject explanations for stock options based on incentives for nonexecutive employ-
 ees. Core, Guay, and Verrecchia (2003) provide more evidence against the standard principal-agent
 model based on the analysis of nonprice performance measures.

 Lower Salaries and No Options? 307

 The reason is that a decrease in options is always associated with a decrease in
 base salary and an increase in stock holdings. However, because we find only
 limited support for the implications of this assumption, we regard this way to
 fix the model as implausible. Taking an altogether different perspective, our
 results could be cited as supporting evidence for the view that CEO compen-
 sation does not conform to the efficient contracting paradigm, and that stock
 options are a vehicle for rent extraction.8 We discuss this view in the concluding
 section.

 Our new empirical approach relates to two other methodologies that are

 widely applied in the literature.9 Several authors calibrate a model such as ours
 in order to analyze various aspects of executive compensation contracts by mak-
 ing parametric assumptions about a "typical" CEO.10 As a consequence, their
 conclusions are sensitive to parametric assumptions that differ across CEOs.
 By calibrating the model to observed parameter values of individual CEOs,
 our conclusions are based on a firmer empirical foundation. An alternative
 approach is to explore the implications of efficient contracting models using re-
 gression analysis.11 Cross-sectional regressions test the qualitative, directional
 implications of theoretical models. Our approach also tests the quantitative im-
 plications, which results in a more stringent test. However, the trade-off is that
 we have to make additional assumptions about functional forms that are absent
 from reduced-form regressions. To the best of our knowledge, the only struc-
 tural test of a principal-agent model of compensation is that of Margiotta and
 Miller (2000), who do not look at options and cannot reject the implications of
 their model.

 The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section I develops the the-
 oretical model in detail. Section II explains our empirical methodology and
 how we implement the model. Section III presents and discusses our empiri-
 cal results for alternative contracting environments. Section IV evaluates the
 implications of these contracts for investment incentives. Section V performs
 a number of robustness checks on our analysis. In Section VI we investigate

 8 Bebchuk and Fried (2004) regard the observed structure of executive compensation as evidence
 for rent extraction. Bertrand and Mullainathan (2000) adopt this view only for companies that have
 weak governance systems.

 9 See also Garen (1994), Haubrich (1994), Haubrich and Popova (1998), and Margiotta and Miller
 (2000) for different econometric approaches. None of these studies allows for stock options. Hall
 and Murphy (2002) conclude that stock options "are a particularly expensive way to convey com-
 pensation," but they do not investigate the relative costs of providing incentives.

 10 The closest paper to ours based on this paradigm is that of Lambert and Larcker (2004), who
 solve a complete principal-agent model and seem to come to different conclusions from ours. We
 discuss their work below. An incomplete list of calibration exercises includes Lambert et al. (1991),
 Hall and Murphy (2000, 2002), Hall and Knox (2004), and Jenter (2002).

 n' See the literature cited in footnote 39 below and the discussion in the survey of Core et al.
 (2003), Section 3.2. Some papers find results that support the principal-agent model, for example,
 Aggarwal and Samwick (1999) and Kedia and Mozumdar (2002). Others come to different conclu-
 sions, for example, Core and Guay (2002b), who contradict Aggarwal and Samwick's findings on
 methodological grounds, and Yermack (1995), who reports that variables associated with agency
 models explain almost none of the cross-sectional variation in the use of options.

 modifications of the base model that may help to reconcile it with the em-
 pirical evidence. In Section VII we summarize our findings and present some
 further thoughts about the limitations of our approach and directions for fu-
 ture research. The more technical aspects of our analysis can be found in the
 Appendix.

 I. Theoretical Model

 We develop a single-period principal-agent framework, following Holmstrim

 (1979). The risk-neutral principal (shareholders) offers a contract to the risk-
 and effort-averse agent (CEO). The CEO consumes only at date T, which marks
 the end of the period. At this point in time the market value of the firm equals
 PT. We ignore leverage and do not distinguish between the market value of
 equity and the market value of the firm. The principal cannot observe the
 agent's effort directly. As a consequence, the contract cannot be a function of
 effort, but it can be a function of PT.

 Technology and Uncertainty. The end-of-period value of the firm PT depends
 on the effort e of the CEO, eE [0; x ), and a standard normal random variable u.
 We use risk-neutral pricing throughout and denote the risk-free rate of interest
 by rf. We discuss our valuation approach in greater detail below (see p. 309).
 We specify:12

 PT(u,e) = Po(e)exp r (r- T + uT-a , u ~ N(0,1). (1)

 Hence, the distribution of PT(u, e) is lognormal with expected present value un-
 der the risk-neutral density equal to Po = E [PTexp{ -rf T}], where Po(e) satisfies
 standard monotonicity and concavity assumptions typically made for produc-
 tion functions, so - > 0 and < 0.13 In any rational expectations equilib-
 rium, Po is equal to the market value of equity at the effort level e* chosen by
 the manager under the given contract, so Po(e*) is equal to the observed market
 capitalization.

 Permissible Contracts. We initially assume that the contract can be described
 by three parameters, namely a base salary 0, the number of shares in the
 company ns (expressed as a fraction of all shares outstanding), and the number
 of options on the company's stock no (also expressed in terms of the number of

 12 This expression assumes a company that does not pay dividends. For a company that pays

 dividends, Po(e) needs to be replaced with Po(e)exp{-dT) for the purpose of valuing options, where
 d is the dividend yield. We adjust for dividends in our empirical work but abstract from them here
 (see also the discussion below Table I on p. 315). The density of the lognormal distribution is given
 in equation A2) in Appendix A.

 13 Here and in the following all expectations are taken with respect to the probability distribu-

 tion u - N(O, 1). We should really write Po = E [PT(U, e)e-rfT] and also write WT, Tr, etc. below as
 functions of u. However, we submerge reference to u for ease of exposition.

 shares outstanding). We further assume that all options granted to the CEO
 have identical maturity T and strike price K. Below we discuss extensions of our
 base model to allow for multiple strike prices. The strike price K is expressed
 as the strike price for no = 1, that is, for the whole company. We denote by Wo
 the wealth of the CEO that is not invested in the firm's securities as of time
 t = 0 and refer to it as "nonfirm wealth." We assume that she invests all her

 nonfirm wealth at the risk-free rate rf, so her end-of-period wealth (at date T)
 is

 WT = (0 + Wo)exp{rf T} + nsPT(u, e) + no max{PT(u,e) - K, 0). (2)

 Note that this specification implicitly assumes that base pay (including bonus
 payments) is paid out today and invested, while all other components of pay
 lead to cash flows to the CEO at date T.

 Preferences. The CEO's utility is separable in wealth and effort and has con-
 stant relative risk aversion with risk aversion parameter y.14 That is,

 U(WT, e) = V(WT) - C(e) = T - C(e). (3)

 1-y

 W 1-Y

 The costs of effort are assumed to be given by some convex cost function C(e)
 with > 0 and > 0. We assume that the CEO has outside employment

 opportunities that give her expected utility U. Expected utility is E[U(WT, e)],
 where expectations are taken with respect to the distribution of WT from (2).

 Risk-Neutral Pricing. We assume risk-neutral pricing in order to ensure con-
 sistency of our approach. This is necessary as we do not distinguish between
 firm-specific risk and market risk. We require that a risk-neutral CEO val-
 ues options in the same way as a diversified market, which implies that the
 certainty equivalent value of one option converges to its Black-Scholes (1973)
 value as risk aversion (y) converges to zero in the context of our model. Suppose
 by contrast that we introduce a risk premium p > rf on the company's stock
 in the present model, without also allowing the CEO to trade in the stock mar-
 ket to obtain the market risk premium. Then any CEO with sufficiently low
 risk aversion (low y) would value the company's stock and stock options higher
 than the market and the certainty equivalent would exceed the Black-Scholes
 value. The reason is that investing in her own company's securities would be
 the only way the CEO could then obtain an expected return above the risk-free
 rate. In order to avoid the paradoxical outcome that the CEO is willing to pay
 a premium above the market price on her company's securities, we work with
 risk-neutral pricing in (1). Effectively, this amounts to the assumption that all
 risk in the model is firm-specific. We discuss this further in Section V below

 14 If y = 1, we define V(WT) = ln(WT). We do not use Wr (which would make U(WT, e) con-

 tinuous in y at y = 1) for numerical reasons.

 and argue that the implied approximation error is small. By contrast, the op-
 posite assumption-treating all risk as systematic-would seriously bias our
 results.15

 Theoretical Solution. We apply the two-stage approach of Grossman and
 Hart (1983) and ask which contract is optimal for implementing a given level
 of effort. Denote the pay of the manager in currency units of time T by

 zrT = exp(rf T) + nsPT + no max{PT - K, 0}. (4)

 Note that WT = Woexp{rf T} + JrT. Denote the present value of expected pay by
 7ro = E[exp{-rfT}7rT]. Then

 7o = q + nsPo + noBS, (5)

 where BS is the Black-Scholes value of the option. The principal's problem is
 to find the contract that implements the chosen effort level ? with the lowest
 costs:

 min m ro = + nsPo + noBS (6)

 (q,ns,no)

 s.t. E[U(WT,e)] > U, (7)

 e = arg max E[U(WT, e)], (8)

 eE[O, c)

 O < ns < 1, no >0, (9)

 S+ Wo > . (10)

 Above, (7) represents the participation constraint, (8) represents the incentive
 compatibility constraint, and (9) defines admissible contracts. Condition (10)
 explicitly allows for negative base salaries whereby the CEO invests some of
 her initial wealth into her company's securities. However, the CEO cannot pay
 more than her total initial nonfirm wealth. 16

 In the second step, the principal will search over all pairs of effort e and

 minimized costs n*(e) in order to find the optimal effort level e*. We do not
 consider this second step in this paper. No matter what the optimal effort level
 e* is, it must solve the first step of the optimization problem (6) to (10): A given
 contract is not optimal if the same effort level can be implemented with a less
 costly contract. It is this implication that we are going to verify for observed
 CEO contracts in the empirical part of this paper.

 "~ See Hall and Murphy (2000) and Tian (2001) for other approaches. The latter also concludes

 that CEOs sometimes value options higher than the market. Cai and Vijh (2005) argue along the
 same lines as we do and show that introducing the market index reduces the value of options to
 the CEO.

 16 Our qualitative results do not change if condition (10) is replaced by 0 > 0, in which case 0* =

 0 whenever program (6) to (10) finds 0* < 0.

 II. Empirical Methodology and Data

 A. Empirical Implementation

 Our first step towards developing an implementable version of the model is
 to apply the first-order approach and replace (8) with the respective first-order
 condition for utility maximization by the CEO. We then discuss how to validate
 the applicability of the first-order approach. Hence, we replace the incentive
 compatibility constraint (8) with the first-order condition for (8),

 de d[U(WPo de de 0. (1)
 d E[U(WT e)] =E[dV(Po) dPo(e) dC(e)
 de dPo de de

 Here we have made use of the fact that Po(e), C(e), and their derivatives are
 not stochastic and therefore can be taken outside of the expectations opera-
 tor. In order to rewrite (11), we define the utility-adjusted pay-for-performance
 sensitivity, UPPS, as follows:

 UPPS =-d exp(-rfT)E[U(WT, e)] = exp(-rfT)E[ dV( WT WT (12)

 dPo dWT dPo"

 We can change the order of integration and differentiation in (11) and (12)
 because the integration limits do not depend on the variables with respect to
 which we differentiate. We observe that in the case of risk neutrality (y = 0),
 we have dV(WT) = 1 for all WT. Thus, it is easy to show that UPPS then equals

 ns + noN(d1), where N(dl) is the option delta from the Black-Scholes formula.
 This is just the standard definition of pay-for-performance sensitivity under
 risk neutrality that is widely used in the analysis of executive stock options,
 and it justifies the definition of (12) as a utility-adjusted pay-for-performance
 sensitivity. We can rewrite (11) using (12) as,

 d dPo(e) dC(e)
 E [U(WT, e)] = UPPS xde exp(rfT)- de= 0. (13)
 de de de

 Finally, we rearrange (13) and obtain,

 UPPS = k (e), (14)

 where k(e) ex-rfTdC (15)

 exp{ -rfT }dC/de

 dPo/de

 The function k(e) is well defined since dPo/de > 0 for all effort levels. Moreover,
 k(e) depends only on the parameters of the cost function of the manager and
 the technology of the company, that is, it is independent of the parameters of
 the contract and risk aversion. Equation (14) is a more useful version of the
 first-order condition (11) for our numerical work because UPPS depends only
 on the observable contract parameters, the CEO's wealth, and her risk aver-
 sion y, and not on the unknown functions Po(e) and C(e). The unknown value
 k(e) can be inferred from the data, because under the null hypothesis that
 observed contracts are optimal, observed contracts must satisfy (14), so that

 k(e) = UPPS(Ad, nd, nd; y, Po(e)), where superscripts "d" denote the contract
 parameters of the observed contract ("data"). Similarly, we can calculate the

 unknown quantities in the participation constraint: E [V(WT (,d, n, nO )] =
 U + C(e). We thus obtain our final program

 min ro = +nsPo + noBS

 (P,ns,no)

 s.t. E[V(WT(,ns, no); y)] = E[V(WT( d,nds, ndo);y)],

 UPPS(O, ns, no; y, Po) = UPPS(Od nds ndo; y, Po),

 O < ns < 1, no > 0, ? > -Wo.

 The only unknown variable that remains in program (16) is y. We use a grid for
 various values of y between 0.5 and 10. This interval encompasses the range of
 values for risk aversion that researchers in the field of executive compensation

 regard as reasonable.17 We also calibrate a simple model in which the CEO can
 invest in both a diversified portfolio and the risk-free asset and find that values
 of y much below two lead to unrealistic predictions about the CEO's investment
 policies."1 Conditional on using the right value of y and assuming that the
 optimal contract does indeed solve (16), the optimal contract must be equal to
 the observed contract, that is, (p*, n*, no) = (od, ni, nd). If the optimal contract
 differs significantly from the observed contract then either the assumed level of
 risk aversion, y, is wrong or the observed contract is not optimal. Program (16)
 has a very intuitive interpretation: We want to find a contract that provides the
 CEO with the same utility and the same incentives as the observed contract,
 but that is less costly to shareholders compared to the observed contract.

 The first-order approach allows us to solve program (6) to (10) without making
 any assumptions on the cost function C(e) except for convexity and without
 making any assumptions on the production function Po(e) except for concavity.
 However, the agent's objective E[U(WT, e)] may still not be concave in effort,
 and may have multiple local optima, as WT is a convex function of PT. Then
 the first-order condition is satisfied at each of these local optima. The modified

 program (16) suggests the optimal contract (0*, ng, n*) that satisfies the first-
 order condition at the same effort level ? as the observed contract (0d, nd, nd).

 17 There is no consensus on the correct value for the Arrow-Pratt measure of relative risk aver-

 sion. Campbell, Lo, and McKinlay (1997), Ch. 8, discuss the extensive literature in macroeconomics
 that suggests values for y up to 10 or 20 in order to reconcile asset pricing models with the equity
 premium puzzle. Chetty (2003) uses a model of labor supply and finds estimates around 1. Extract-
 ing estimates of risk aversion from asset prices has also not converged to a consensus. Ait-Sahalia
 and Lo (2000) summarize research on the subject (see their Table VII) and report values between
 0 and 55. The compensation literature typically uses lower values (e.g., Murphy (1999) uses 1, 2,
 and 3).

 Is Consider a CEO with CRRA utility who can invest in a market portfolio with a = 0.17 and a
 risk premium over the risk-free rate of 4%. Then a CEO with y = 0.5 would leverage her portfolio
 and invest 277% of her wealth in the market portfolio. With y = 1, she would still invest 138%;
 with y = 2, the portfolio would be 69% in the market and 31% in the risk-free asset.

 This shows only that the global optimum under the existing contract remains
 a local optimum under the contract that solves (16). This does not rule out
 the possibility that the global optimum for the agent under the new contract
 implies an entirely different effort level e 4 . If the effort level chosen by the
 agent under the new contract is higher (e > i), then no problem arises for our
 approach as this would also imply a higher value for the firm, that is, P > Po.
 However, we need to verify that the agent does not choose a lower level of effort
 under the contract that solves program (16).

 In our case, we cannot establish the validity of the first-order approach ana-
 lytically because we restrict the shape of the optimal contract. Thus, we formu-
 late a sufficient condition for the applicability of the first-order approach and
 validate it empirically. We prove the following result in Appendix A.

 PROPOSITION 1 (First-order approach): Let (0*, n*, n*) be the optimal contract
 that solves (16). Also, let e be the effort level chosen under the existing contract.

 If

 UPPS(?*,, n*o; y,P)> UPPS(d, nd, ndy,Po) (17)

 for all P < Po, then the agent will never choose an effort level e < ? under the
 new contract (P*, n', n*). If the restriction no > 0 in program (16) is relaxed,

 then condition (17) is always satisfied for all contracts for which n* < 0.

 Proposition 1 implies that checking condition (17) is sufficient to ensure that

 the CEO will not choose a lower effort level under the optimal contract from
 program (16) than under the existing contract. We are not concerned about
 higher effort levels as these lead to higher market values of the firm and would
 therefore reinforce the claim that the existing contract is not optimal. We val-
 idate (17) by checking this condition for a grid of 100 equally spaced values of
 P in the interval (0, Po] whenever n* > 0.

 B. Data Set

 To implement (16), we need data on the contract parameters 0d, nd, and

 no, the CEO's wealth Wo, the firm value Po, the dividend yield d, the option
 maturity T, the strike price K, the stock volatility a, and the risk-free rate rf.
 Our data are constructed from the Compustat ExecuComp Database, which
 contains compensation data on 21,086 executives from 2,448 firms over the
 period 1992 to 2000. We first identify all executives in the database who are
 CEO in 2000 and have a continuous history (as CEO or as another executive
 with data on ExecuComp) of at least 5 years (1995 to 1999) in the database.
 We focus on CEOs in order to prevent correlations due to multiple observations
 from the same firm.

 We match Po to the market capitalization at the 1999 fiscal year-end and

 take the 1999 values of the dividend yield d and the volatility a directly from
 the database. The fixed salary qd is determined as the sum of salary and bonus

 in 2000 and includes all types of compensation other than stock and options.19
 Hence, we implicitly assume that bonus payments have no relevance for the
 CEO's incentives.20 We only use current-period data to estimate od. This ignores
 the fact that the CEO receives base salary payments every year between now
 and T. Incorporating this feature would have the same numerical impact as an
 increase in nonfirm wealth Wo, which we study below. We therefore abstract
 from this feature.

 The variables nd and nd are the numbers of shares and options, respectively,
 held by the CEO at the end of the 1999 fiscal year. ExecuComp does not provide
 details of all option parameters, so we approximate the option portfolios held
 at the end of 1999 using the algorithm described by Core and Guay (2002a). Ac-
 cording to this algorithm, we approximate options granted before 1999 by two
 hypothetical option grants that are calculated from information on exercisable
 and unexercisable options. We add the options granted in 1999 to these two
 hypothetical option grants in order to arrive at an estimate of the option port-
 folio held at the end of the 1999 fiscal year. Then we calculate the exercise price
 K and the maturity T of a representative option that aggregates the salient
 features (value and sensitivity to price) of the CEO's option portfolio. We refer
 the reader to Appendix B for further details. Appendix B also describes the
 procedure we use to estimate nonfirm wealth from the CEO's past income.21
 Below we perform robustness checks in order to establish that our results do
 not depend on potential estimation errors.

 From the initial 1,696 CEOs in 2000, we lose 103 CEOs for whom necessary

 data items (stock volatility in 1999 or adjustment factor) are missing, and 886
 CEOs due to the 5-year history requirement.22 The 5-year cutoff provides a rea-
 sonable balance between the accuracy of our estimates and sample size.23 An-
 other 27 CEOs are lost because they are executives in more than one company
 in at least 1 year of their history. For the remaining 680 CEOs we estimate their
 option portfolio and their wealth from the ExecuComp database as described
 in Appendix B. At this stage, we lose 17 CEOs because of inconsistent or miss-
 ing data on their option holdings, and 65 CEOs because our wealth estimate is
 negative, which can happen if the amounts deducted for the purchase of stock
 are large. Our final sample satisfying all our data requirements consists of 598

 19 More precisely, 0d is the sum of the following four ExecuComp data types: Salary, Bonus,

 Other Annual, and All Other Total. We do not include LTIP (long-term incentive pay), as these are
 typically not awarded annually.

 20 This seems defensible. Hall and Liebman (1998) argue that the impact of stock options and

 stock on CEO wealth dwarfs the impact of bonus payments.

 21 The only study we know of that uses an estimate of wealth is Becker (2006), who uses a

 Swedish data set based on tax filings. No such information is available for the U.S.

 22 We do not require that the CEOs have been the acting CEO during the entire 5 years. We only

 require that they be CEO in 2000.

 23 If we required instead 8 years of continuous history, we would retain only 360 CEOs compared
 to our current sample of 598. By shortening the length of continuous history, we bias our wealth
 estimates downward. Indeed, requiring an 8-year history would increase our median estimate of
 Wo by 27% (mean: 21%). We compensate for this bias with appropriate robustness checks (see
 Section V).

 sample, $1.7 million in ExecuComp). Also, CEOs in our sample are somewhat
 more experienced (age 57 in our sample, 55 in the database). Finally, note that
 the stock volatility is lower in our sample (38%) than in the full ExecuComp
 database (44%). In view of our results, the sample is biased in favor of the model:
 The savings from recontracting predicted by our model are higher for higher
 volatility, higher option holdings, and younger, less wealthy CEOs. We would
 therefore expect even stronger results if we could establish reliable parameter
 estimates for the larger sample.

 III. Optimal Contracts and Observed Contracts

 We divide our analysis into two parts. In the first part we restrict ourselves
 to contracts with nonnegative option holdings no. We therefore require that
 contracts are (weakly) convex. This is our benchmark case. In the second part
 we relax this constraint and allow for negative option holdings by the CEO.
 We then drop the assumption that contracts are piecewise linear and extend
 our analysis to more general forms of nonlinearity. Finally, we discuss how our
 analysis extends to the case with multiple options.

 A. Optimal Contracts with Nonnegative Option Holdings

 Table II reports the results for the case in which option holdings are restricted

 to be nonnegative.24

 RESULT 1: The model cannot replicate observed option holdings.

 The first, and probably most surprising, result is that stock options are almost
 never optimal for plausible levels of risk aversion (see Table II, Panel A). The
 model predicts positive option holdings only for 1.3% of all CEOs at y = 3, and
 even for extremely low levels of risk aversion this fraction does not rise above
 18% (y = 0.5). Moreover, whenever the model does predict options as part of
 the optimal contract, the fraction of options predicted is miniscule: For y = 3
 optimal option holdings are 0.003%. This represents less than 0.3% of actual
 option holdings (see Table I), indicating the complete failure of the model with
 respect to predicting the option component of observed contracts. Moreover,
 we only obtain positive option holdings for those cases in which the constraint
 0 > -Wo is binding; in all other cases optimal option holdings are always zero.
 This result is striking and shows that the constraint no > 0 is almost always
 binding to produce a corner solution at no = 0.

 For low levels of risk aversion we sometimes cannot validate the applicability
 of the first-order approach. For y = 0.5 there are three CEOs with positive option
 holdings under the contract that solves (16) where condition (17) is violated.

 24 We solve program (16) and its variants for each CEO in our data set with the Nelder-Mead
 (1965) simplex method as implemented in SAS Proc IML. We also recompute our core results with
 Matlab and do not find any differences beyond numerical accuracy.

 Table II

 Optimal Contracts with Nonnegative Option Holdings

 This table describes the optimal restricted option contract, that is, the optimal contract subject to the
 constraint that option holdings must be nonnegative (no > 0). Panel A displays the mean and me-
 dian of the three contract parameters: base salary %*, stock holdings ns*, and adjusted option holdings
 nsgexp{-dT}. In addition, it shows the fraction of CEOs with positive option holdings (no* > 0) and the
 fraction of CEOs with negative base salaries (0* < 0). Panel B describes the additional investment the
 CEO should make into her own company according to the optimal contract, and the savings the firm
 could realize by switching from observed contracts to optimal contracts. Wealth that must be invested
 is equal to -min(q*, 0). Investment relative to wealth is this investment scaled by the CEO's wealth,

 -min(?*, 0)/Wo. Savings are the difference in compensation costs between observed contracts and opti-
 mal contracts, rd - o*. Savings in percent of total pay are (rod - T o*)hrod, and savings in percent of firm
 value are (rod - r*)/Po. Results are shown for nine different values of the parameter of risk aversion
 y. For y = 0.5, the table contains three CEOs for which we cannot verify condition (17). This condition
 ensures that the first-order approach is always valid. For all remaining y-CEO combinations, condition
 (17) can be verified.

 half a percentage point. It follows directly from the mechanics of the model that
 lower option holdings are balanced by higher stock holdings in order to maintain
 incentives. Hence, stock holdings in optimal contracts are uniformly higher, and
 for any given level of risk aversion the algorithm provides a unique optimal
 level of stock holdings commensurate with maintaining incentives. Table II,
 Panel A also demonstrates that the number of additional shares required to be
 held by the CEO decreases markedly as the CEO's risk aversion y increases.
 This implies that the number of shares given to the CEO to replace one option
 decreases with risk aversion. As the CEO's risk aversion rises, stock becomes
 progressively better at providing incentives because stock also pays off for lower
 stock prices, where marginal utility is comparatively high, in which case fewer
 shares need to be granted to replace one option.

 RESULT 3: CEOs should receive lower base salaries.

 We can observe from Table II, Panel A that mean and median base salaries
 decline substantially if we compare the base salaries suggested by the model
 with actual base salaries. If we substitute stock for less valuable options, then
 the base salary needs to decrease so that the CEO's expected utility stays con-
 stant and the participation constraint (7) remains binding. Table II, Panel A
 shows that our model suggests a large number of CEOs in our sample should
 have negative base salaries. If base salaries are negative, then CEOs must in-
 vest some of their private savings, in addition to the stock grants they receive,
 in their company's stock. For y = 3, 47% of CEOs receive no base salary and
 are required to invest some of their private wealth into their firm.

 Note that as the CEO's risk aversion y increases, the pay cuts suggested by

 our model decrease substantially. This is an immediate consequence of the fact
 that the number of shares each CEO receives to replace one option decreases
 in y, and it implies that the cut in base pay necessary to hold her expected
 utility constant falls as well. In Table II, Panel B we relate the investment in
 firm stock to CEO wealth. While the cut in base salaries appears dramatic, it
 is moderate compared to most CEOs' wealth. For y = 3, on average the CEOs
 invest $2.26 million or 10.5% of their wealth in their firms' stock.

 We also investigate how base salaries are correlated with wealth (results not
 tabulated). The correlation is negative and significant, ranging from -0.51 for
 y = 0.5 to -0.20 for y = 10. This is intuitive as higher wealth leads to lower
 absolute risk aversion and therefore a higher ratio of shares to be exchanged
 for one option. Recall that we calculate wealth on the basis of past income
 (see Appendix B). So, according to the model, some CEOs received too high
 fixed salaries in the past, leading to a larger accumulation of nonfirm wealth.
 According to the model these contracts need a stronger rebalancing away from
 options and fixed salary toward more stock.

 RESULT 4: Implied savings from optimal contracts are significant.

 We need to determine whether the differences between observed and actual

 contracts are economically significant. We address this issue by comparing the

 expected costs of total compensation of optimal contracts, -r, to the costs of ob-

 served compensation contracts, tod. Hence, rd_ - O (expressed as a percentage
 of 7rd) is our measure for evaluating economic significance, which we tabulate
 in Table II, Panel B.

 Based on our model and assuming y = 3, on average 19.6% of the total costs
 of CEO compensation could be saved by moving from observed contracts to
 the contracts suggested by the model (median 15.6%). While this number is
 significant as a proportion of compensation costs as well as in absolute dollar
 terms ($12.3 million (mean), $2.4 million (median) per CEO), the number is not
 large in relation to the size of most companies. The average savings as a per-
 centage of firm value is merely 0.34%. However, we only consider CEOs in our
 analysis. Since typically the structure of compensation packages is similar for
 all executives within a single company, the savings would be higher than sug-
 gested by Table II if companies adjust the pay structure for all their executives.
 Altogether we conclude that the difference between observed contracts and con-
 tracts generated by the conventional model are statistically and economically
 significant.

 B. Optimal Contracts with Unrestricted Option Holdings

 The previous analysis suggests that the nonnegativity constraint on options
 in the optimal contract (no > 0) is binding in almost all cases. We now replace
 this constraint with the weaker restriction that the CEO cannot have a short

 position in options that exceeds her long position in stock: noexp{-dT) + ns >
 0. This restriction is necessary to guarantee that the CEO's terminal wealth
 WT is positive in all states of the world. We refer to the contract with this
 relaxed restriction as the "unrestricted option contract," whereas we refer to the
 contract with the stronger restriction no > 0 as the "restricted option contract."
 We recompute all our previous results for the unrestricted option contract and
 present the results in Table III.

 The impact is dramatic. For all CEOs for whom we find zero optimal op-

 tion holdings in the previous section, we now obtain negative option holdings.
 At the same time, optimal stock holdings almost double from 2.75% to 5.33%
 (y = 3). The resulting contract is now concave for 98.7% of all CEOs. Pay-
 for-performance sensitivity for low stock prices (below the strike price of the
 option) is significantly higher because of the higher stock component. For stock
 prices above the strike price of the option, pay-for-performance sensitivity is
 miniscule. For a large number of CEOs, pay-for-performance sensitivity is zero
 for higher stock prices. In these cases, the number of options just offsets the
 number of shares. Average base salaries are lower (-$16.6 million instead of
 -$1.65 million for y = 3) and the proportion of wealth that CEOs would need to
 invest in their companies' stock is also much higher (47.5% instead of 10.5%).
 The unrestricted contract also generates much higher savings (36.5% instead
 of 19.6% before). We therefore conclude that our model implies that optimal
 contracts are concave except in very few cases.

 Table III

 Optimal Contracts with Unrestricted Option Holdings

 This table describes the optimal unrestricted option contract, that is, the optimal contract under
 the weaker restriction that the CEO cannot sell more options than the number of shares she owns
 (ns + no exp{-dT} > 0). Panel A displays the mean and median of the three contract parameters:
 base salary 0*, stock holdings ns* (which is the pay-for-performance sensitivity for PT < K), and
 the sum of stock holdings and adjusted option holdings ns* + no* exp{-dT} (which is the pay-
 for-performance sensitivity for PT > K). In addition, the table shows the fraction of CEOs with
 pay-for-performance sensitivity equal to zero for PT > K (nS* + no exp{-dT} = 0) and the fraction
 of CEOs with negative base salary (0* < 0). Panel B describes the additional investment the CEO
 should make into her own company according to the optimal contract, and the savings the firm could
 realize by switching from observed contracts to optimal contracts. Wealth that must be invested is
 equal to -min(o*, 0). Investment relative to wealth is this investment scaled by the CEO's wealth,

 -min(o*, O)/Wo. Savings are the difference in compensation costs between observed contracts and

 optimal contracts, rod_ - ro*. Savings in percent of total pay are (rod - r0*)/d, and savings in percent

 of firm value are (m0d - ro*)/Po. Results are shown for nine different values of the parameter of
 risk aversion y. For y = 0.5, the table contains three CEOs for which we cannot verify condition
 (17). This condition ensures that the first-order approach is always valid. For all remaining y-CEO
 combinations, condition (17) can be verified.

 C. General Nonlinear Contracts

 In order to understand why the optimal contract features negative option
 holdings for most CEOs, we now consider contracts in which we do not restrict
 the nonlinearity to piecewise linear contracts. Instead, we now analyze the
 solution to the optimal contracting problem (6) to (10) for a general function
 7(PT) that is not constrained to be implemented with stock and options. In
 Appendix A.1 we derive the following solution for n(PT), where al > 0 and Uo
 are parameters that depend on the production function Po(e) and the Lagrange
 multipliers on the constraints (7) and (8):

 (P(T)= (ao + l In PT)liY - Wo exp(rfT) if PT > P(18)

 -Wo exp(rfT) + s if PT < P,

 where P = exp((eY - ao)/ai) and the constant E is the minimum level of wealth
 that must be left to the CEO in all states of the world. This ensures that the

 argument of the utility function is bounded away from zero so that utility is
 bounded away from minus infinity. In Appendix A.1 we also show that the
 optimal contract is concave for all prices PT above a certain threshold that
 exceeds P for y < 1 and equals P for y > 1. For y < 1, the function is convex
 for a range above P. In all cases the function is locally convex at P. We refer to
 the contract with the pay function (18) as the "general nonlinear contract."

 The fact that the optimal general nonlinear contract features a convex re-
 gion holds the promise that we do not detect the potential usefulness of options
 because contracts with only one option may be ill-suited to approximate a non-
 linear function with convex and concave regions. Clearly, the n (PT) function (18)
 is not implementable with shares and options, although it can be approximated
 arbitrarily well with a sufficiently large number of call and put options with
 different strike prices.25 We can still estimate optimal contracts such as (18)
 using our methodology by simply optimizing over the free parameters ao, a1l,
 and e without parameterizing the full model.26 In particular, we can do so with-
 out specifying the production function Po(e), the CEO's cost function C(e), or
 the Lagrange multipliers on (7) and (8). Figure 1 shows the results for one
 representative CEO and Table IV tabulates the results for the entire sample.27

 Figure 1 depicts alternative contracts for one representative CEO with y =

 3. The figure shows the observed contract with one representative option, the
 unrestricted option contract, and the general nonlinear contract. The horizontal
 axis in the figure is scaled by the current stock price, so that one corresponds

 25 Related claims can be found in Ross (1976) and Farmer and Winter (1986).
 26 For numerical reasons, we restrict the CEO's minimum terminal wealth e by e > Po/100,000.
 When we relax this restriction, the algorithm becomes unstable. In Table IV, the numerical prob-
 lems of relaxing this constraint become apparent for y = 10, where we lose 52% of the CEOs
 because the algorithm does not converge. The only notable effect of relaxing this constraint is that
 the threshold P/Po in Table IV gets even smaller and that average savings slightly increase.

 27 We note that the validity of the first-order approach for the general nonlinear contract is

 assured by Jewitt (1988).

 to a terminal stock price PT equal to the current price. The general nonlinear
 contract is highly concave with an enormous slope for low terminal stock prices
 (below 10% to 20% of the current price). We characterize the function in Table IV
 by reporting the average cutoff price P from (18) as a percentage of the current
 stock price. Evidently, this cutoff is very small (0.5% to 4.2% of the current
 stock price) for moderate levels of risk aversion.28 Hence, the point of the local
 convexity of the optimal contract is in a region of very low (and hence unlikely)
 stock prices.

 We report the slope of the contract by looking at changes in wealth if the stan-
 dard normal random variable u in (1) changes from its expected value of 0 to

 28 The comparatively high values of P/Po for y = 1 are due to the fact that the utility function
 is not continuous in y at y = 1. We expect that this effect would disappear if we could calculate
 optimal contracts for the related version of the utility function (see footnote 14) that is continuous
 in y at y = 1.

 Optimal General Nonlinear Contract

 This table describes the optimal contract with the general nonlinear pay function xr(PT) = min{(ao +
 allnPT)1l", 1} - Woexp(rfT) from equation (18). We do not tabulate summary statistics for the pa-

 rameters uo, r1, and E, because they cannot be interpreted independent of each other. Instead,
 the table displays the median cutoff point P/Po (where P is the point at which the minimum E
 is attained) and the median change in wealth when the stock price changes from PT(O) to PT(U),
 where u = -4, -1, +1, +4. In addition, the table shows average savings as a percentage of to-

 tal pay (od - _ro*)hrod from switching from observed contracts to optimal contracts. Results are
 shown for nine different values of the parameter of risk aversion y. For all y-CEO combinations
 the general validity of the first-order approach (condition (17)) can be verified. The last row shows
 the corresponding statistics for the observed contracts. Results for y = 1 are not comparable to the
 results for other values of y, because the utility function is not continuous in y at y = 1.

 -1, -4, +1, or +4. For example, for y = 3, if u = +1 (one standard devia-
 tion above its mean), then wealth increases by 5.9% for the optimal contract,
 whereas the same number is 107.4% for the actual contract. For u = -1, the
 change is -6.7% for the optimal contract and -27.4% for the actual contract.
 Hence, for y = 3, the ?1 standard deviation range exhibits a lower pay-for-
 performance sensitivity than the observed contract and this difference becomes
 more pronounced as risk aversion increases. We can also measure the concavity
 of the optimal general nonlinear contract by the fact that a one-standard devia-
 tion decrease in u is accompanied by a larger absolute change in wealth (-6.7%)
 compared to a one-standard deviation increase of u (5.9%). The opposite is true
 for the observed contract, where the decline (-27.36%) is much smaller than
 the corresponding increase (107.4%). For low levels of risk aversion the opti-
 mal contract includes large penalties for extreme underperformance: The CEO
 loses more than 99% of her wealth if u falls more than four standard deviations

 below its expected value, an event that has a probability of 0.0032%.

 Overall, we find that the optimal general nonlinear contract differs from the

 observed contract not only quantitatively but also qualitatively. The observed

 contracts essentially rely on "carrots," where the CEO receives large benefits
 from performing above expectations and suffers limited penalties for under-
 performance. By comparison, the optimal general nonlinear contract relies on
 "sticks," where the CEO receives only a comparatively small increase in wealth
 for outperforming expectations but suffers severe penalties from extreme
 underperformance.

 The piecewise linear contract that can be implemented with one option tries to

 approximate the optimal general nonlinear contract. We can gauge the quality
 of this approximation by comparing the savings implied by these contracts.
 These are 45.2% for general nonlinear contracts and 36.5% for unrestricted
 option contracts.

 We could approximate the general nonlinear contract in Figure 1 with stock
 and short positions in several call options with different strike prices. By appro-
 priately increasing the number of different strike prices in the option portfolio
 we could approximate the optimal general nonlinear contract 7r*(PT) arbitrar-
 ily well. Then the positions in all options except the one with the lowest strike
 price would be short positions. We analyze the case with stock and two options,
 fixing strike prices at 25% and 50% of today's price. We find that savings from
 such a contract are 39.0% (results not tabulated), which are higher than those
 for unrestricted option contracts (36.5%, see Table III) and restricted option
 contracts (19.6%, see Table II), but lower than those for general nonlinear con-
 tracts (45.2%, see Table IV). The contracts suggested by such a model exhibit
 even higher stock holdings compared to the model with only one option, with
 correspondingly more negative positions in options. However, all other qualita-
 tive features are the same as those of the model with one option only, so we do
 not discuss them here in more detail.

 IV. Investment Incentives and Optimal Contracts

 The discussion of the previous section leads us to the conclusion that long
 positions in options are rarely part of an optimal contract. In this subsection
 we investigate another explanation for the use of stock options that was first
 formulated by Smith and Stulz (1985) and that emphasizes the fact that op-
 tions provide incentives for managers to invest in risky projects. A number
 of studies find indirect evidence in support of this notion.29 We approach this
 question from the perspective of our model as follows. A CEO would be deterred
 from investing in a positive net present value (NPV) project if the project in-
 creases the risk of the company and her utility decreases in the volatility of the

 29 Williams and Rao (2000) show that CEOs with more stock options tend to undertake risk-
 increasing acquisitions. Tufano (1996) shows that companies in the gold mining industry hedge
 more if their executives own more stock and less if they hold more options. Guay (1999) provides
 evidence that companies with more growth opportunities provide their executives with more in-
 centives to take risks. Rajgopal and Shevlin (2002) find that stock options increase the inclination
 to take risks in a study of oil and gas producers. Similarly, Li (2002) presents evidence consistent
 with the view that companies continuously adjust the contracts of their CEOs if they deviate from
 contracts that provide optimal risk-taking incentives.

 company, so that EU< 0. Hence, we compute this derivative and determine
 by how much the CEO's utility would fall from a one-percentage point increase
 in volatility (e.g., from 0.30 to 0.31) and compare this change in utility be-
 tween the observed contract and the optimal contract prescribed by the model.30
 Table V summarizes our results.

 For example, for y = 3, on average utility decreases by 2.51% given a one-
 percentage point increase in volatility under the observed contract, by 3.00%
 under the optimal restricted contract, and by 4.42% from the optimal unre-
 stricted contract. By comparison, the decline in utility is 18.37% under the
 optimal general nonlinear contract, which is therefore significantly more con-
 cave.

 In Table V, Panel B we provide another approach to the same data. Here, we
 define a CEO as risk averse if her utility declines by more than 1% from a one
 percentage point increase in volatility, and as risk neutral if her utility declines
 by less than 1%. With this definition of risk aversion and risk neutrality, for y =
 3, 26.3% of all CEOs are classified as risk neutral under the observed contract,
 compared to 18.6% under the optimal restricted contract and 8.7% under the
 optimal unrestricted option contract. This percentage drops to a mere 1.3% un-
 der the general nonlinear contract. We also apply other cutoffs for separating
 risk neutral from risk averse CEOs. With a 0.1% decline in utility as a cut-
 off, 95.3% of the CEOs would be classified as risk averse under the observed
 contract, a proportion that increases to 99.5% and 100% under the restricted
 option contract and the two concave contracts (y = 3), respectively.

 We interpret these results as suggesting that observed contracts normally do

 not change the CEO's attitude towards risk appreciably in one way or another
 compared to optimal restricted contracts. The proportion of CEOs whose risk
 aversion is practically neutralized by their option holdings (so that EU 0) is
 small, no matter which definition of "practically neutralized" we apply. Even
 compared to optimal unrestricted contracts, which are concave for most CEOs,
 the difference is moderate. The picture is very different only for the general
 nonlinear contract (18) that may carry a serious risk of underinvestment in
 risky projects. For this contract, the distortion of risk aversion as shown in
 Table V is more substantial and the fraction of CEOs classified as risk neutral

 is significantly smaller. We conclude that while the use of stock options to create
 risk-taking incentives might explain why we do not observe general nonlinear
 contracts, this argument does not appear strong enough to explain why observed
 contracts are convex instead of linear.31

 V. Robustness Checks

 In this section we discuss some of the assumptions we make above in order to

 assess the robustness of our conclusions presented so far. As a benchmark we

 30 Guay (1999) analyzes sensitivies of wealth to risk by looking at 1% changes in a.
 31 Other authors also express skepticism on the view that options uniformly increase risk-taking

 incentives; see, for example, Carpenter (2000) and Ross (2004).

 Table V

 Investment Incentives

 This table displays results on the change of the CEO's utility to a one-percentage point increase in
 the firm's volatility for the different types of contracts, that is,

 (E[V(q, ns, no, a + 0.01)1 - E[V(4, ns, no, aul)/IEE[V(4, ns, no, a)]I.

 Panel A shows the mean and the median of this change for four different contracts: the observed
 contract, the restricted option contract, the unrestricted option contract, and the general nonlinear
 contract. Panel B contains the proportion of CEOs we classify as risk neutral under each of the
 four contracts. We use two different definitions of risk neutral: In the left part of Panel B, we call a
 CEO risk neutral if her sensitivity to a 0.01 increase in volatility (as defined above) exceeds -0.01.
 In the right part of Panel A, we classify a CEO as risk neutral if the sensitivity exceeds -0.001.
 Results are shown for nine different values of the parameter of risk aversion y. We only include
 those y-CEO combinations for which we can calculate all three contracts. Results for y = 1 are not
 comparable to the results for other values of y, because the utility function is not continuous in y
 at y = 1.

 choose the model with restricted option contracts. While unrestricted option
 contracts or general nonlinear contracts generate higher savings, they seem
 less realistic. First, negative options holdings are never used. Second, concave
 payoffs are unsuitable for providing risk-taking incentives as we demonstrate
 in the previous section. Finally, the implied investments in company stock com-
 pared to CEOs' wealth seem unrealistically large (47.5% for unrestricted option
 contracts compared to 10.5% for restricted option contracts; compare Tables II
 and III). We therefore believe that restricted option contracts provide the most
 realistic alternative to observed contracts.

 A. Measurement of Wealth

 The variable measured with the least accuracy in our data is certainly initial
 nonfirm wealth Wo. In order to establish how sensitive our results are to errors
 in initial wealth, we multiply our wealth estimates by a multiplier Mw and
 compute optimal contracts assuming y = 3. Results for other levels of risk
 aversion are qualitatively similar. We consider multipliers Mw in the range
 from 0.1 to 5. The main results are summarized in Figure 2.

 The main observations from the figure are that (1) investment in stock as a
 percentage of wealth increases in wealth (i.e., as a function of Mw), (2) stock
 holdings increase in wealth, and (3) savings from recontracting are a declining
 function of wealth. On the whole we observe what we would expect as a result
 of constant relative risk aversion, where absolute risk aversion falls as wealth

 increases. The effect of an increase in wealth is therefore the same as the effect

 of a fall in risk aversion, which Tables II to V document amply. Hence, none of
 our qualitative conclusions is affected and the comparative static properties of
 the model are very regular.

 B. Measuring the Convexity of Contracts

 Our analysis relies only on shares and stock options to measure pay-for-
 performance sensitivity. By comparison, Jensen and Murphy (1990) also con-
 sider the incentives generated by bonus payments and CEO dismissals as part
 of their measure of performance sensitivity. The potentially incorrect measure-
 ment of the convexity of observed contracts is of particular concern for our
 analysis. We address these shortcomings here.

 We run conventional logit regressions for CEO dismissals (see Brickley (2003)
 for a brief summary of the literature on CEO turnover). The dummy variable
 for dismissal equals one if a CEO who is in the database in 1995 is recorded as
 "resigned" in one of the subsequent 5 years. We regress this dummy variable on
 the 5-year abnormal stock return from 1995 to 2000. We then use this parame-
 terization of the logistic function to establish the probability of firing the CEO
 as a function of the stock return p(PT/Po) and redefine end-of-period wealth as
 a function of terminal stock prices (compare (2)) as

 WT = WO exp{rf T? + (1 - p(PT/Po))[q5 exp{rf T)

 + nsPT(u, e) + no max{PT(u, e) - K, 0}]. (19)

 Similar to Jensen and Murphy (1990) we assume that the CEO loses all her
 compensation in the event of dismissal, which is most likely an overstatement
 as this ignores severance pay. We then recompute the utility-adjusted pay-
 for-performance sensitivity using (19) instead of (2). The results are shown in
 Table VI.

 Table VI reveals that UPPS increases for high levels of risk aversion, but

 decreases for small levels of risk aversion. The reason is that dismissals affect

 performance sensitivity in two ways. First, the potential loss of all future com-
 pensation payments increases UPPS because an upward shift in the mean of
 the distribution reduces the CEO's risk of being fired. However, with probabil-
 ity p(PT/Po) the CEO loses all her performance-related pay, so conditional on
 being fired, the CEO's payoff is now independent of her performance, which
 reduces incentives. The weight on the two effects depends on the CEO's utility
 function. The higher her risk aversion, the more important is the first effect
 and the less important is the second effect.

 We also measure the convexity of contracts directly. Observed contracts are
 piecewise linear, so we cannot use second-order derivatives to analyze convexity.
 Instead, we use a discrete approach and measure the difference in slopes of WT
 with respect to PT from (2) and from (19) around the strike price of the option.32
 For (2) the change in slope is simply no (the slope changes from ns to ns + no).

 32 More precisely, we measure the difference in slopes of WT between u(K) + 1 and u(K) - 1,

 where P(u(K)) = K (see equation (1)).

 Table VI

 Dismissals and UPPS

 This table shows the change of the CEOs' utility-adjusted pay-for-performance sensitivity (UPPS)
 and the change of their expected utility when the threat of being dismissed is taken into account.
 "Change in UPPS" is UPPS in the model with threat of dismissal divided by UPPS in the model
 without threat of dismissal minus one. In order to specify the probability of dismissal, we estimate
 a logit regression in which the dependent variable is equal to one if an executive who is CEO in 1995
 leaves the company within the next 5 years and if ExecuComp records "resigned" as the reason
 for leaving. The independent variable is the firm's abnormal return over these 5 years, that is, the
 log of the firm's gross return minus the log of the S&P 500 gross return. The parameter estimates
 (standard errors) are -2.704 (0.136) for the intercept and -0.415 (0.077) for the slope. The change
 in expected utility can drop below -100%, as expected utility is negative for y > 1. Results for
 y = 1 are not comparable to the results for other values of y, because the utility function is not
 continuous in y at y = 1.

 Risk Change in UPPS Change in Expected Utility
 Aversion Mean Median Mean Median

 0.5 -4.17% -4.11% -2.63% -2.59%
 1 -2.59% -2.59% -30.09% -5.67%
 2 0.96% 0.60% -6.51% -5.95%
 3 4.85% 3.93% -14.39% -12.62%
 4 9.06% 7.24% -23.72% -19.87%

 8 30.51% 21.40% -100.41% -55.17%
 10 46.18% 29.10% -268.65% -78.44%

 We calculate this change in slope for (19) and find that for 494 CEOs, dismissals
 reduce the convexity of the WT function, whereas the convexity increases for
 104 of the CEOs in our sample; 11 contracts become concave (results are not
 reported in the tables). For the median CEO, dismissals reduce the convexity
 of the WT function by 4.86%, that is, the change in slope is 0.951no in the
 model with dismissals compared to no without dismissals, so the difference is
 economically negligible.

 We also look at bonus payments and test whether their sensitivity to stock

 price increases is higher for high stock prices than for low prices. We find that
 bonus and salary changes make the contracts more convex, although this effect
 is mostly statistically insignificant.

 We conclude that we measure the convexity of contracts correctly, on average,
 even though there is some cross-sectional variation arising from CEO turnover
 and changes in salaries that we do not pick up before. We note that our approach
 has the additional advantage that it uses only CEO-specific variables and does
 not impose parameters from cross-sectional regressions based on the whole
 sample on individual CEOs.

 Optimal Contracts with Gamma-Distributed Stock Price

 This table displays the means of six variables that describe the optimal restricted option contract for
 the alternative model in which the stock price PT follows a Gamma distribution. The table displays
 the mean of the three contract parameters: base salary 0*, stock holdings ns*, and adjusted option
 holdings n* exp{-dT}. In addition, it shows the fraction of CEOs with positive option holdings
 (n* > 0). Savings are the difference in compensation costs between observed contracts and optimal

 contracts, 7rd - r. Savings in percent of total pay are (-d - r)/r d. Results are shown for nine
 different values of the parameter of risk aversion y. The number of CEOs for whom we cannot
 verify the sufficient condition (17) is shown in the column "Violations of condit. (17)."

 Verrecchia (2000) suggest the Gamma distribution as an alternative model for
 the technology in a principal-agent model and show that it can generate convex
 contracts for y = 0.5. We therefore repeat our analysis replacing the lognor-
 mal distribution with the Gamma distribution and calibrating the distribution
 again to match the first two moments (market capitalization and standard de-
 viation of returns). Table VII summarizes the main results.

 Our results are consistent with those of Hemmer et al. (2000): For y = 0.5,
 we obtain significant option holdings for all CEOs.33 However, for larger values
 of risk aversion the differences between the lognormal distribution and the
 Gamma distribution become small, and for y > 4 implied savings are larger on
 average with the Gamma model than with the lognormal model. For reasons
 discussed above, we do not believe that the region below y = 1 is particularly
 relevant; thus, we conclude that this approach does not lead to a substantially
 more realistic model.

 D. Market Risk and Firm-Specific Risk

 In the discussion of our valuation approach above we briefly hint at the fact
 that our approach may overstate the riskiness of options to the CEO as she

 33 This also leads to a violation of the sufficient conditions for the validity of the first-order
 approach in a large number of cases. Hence, for low values of y this analysis is valid only if we
 are also prepared to assume conditions stronger than just concavity of the production function and
 convexity of the cost function.

 could eliminate the market component of this risk by trading in the market
 index, an aspect not included in our model. We determine the importance of the
 distinction between firm-specific risk and market risk as follows. We estimate
 firm-specific risk oa by using the relationship oa = , 2 _ 2/ , where a rep-
 resents the volatility of the market and P the CAPM beta. We assume P = 1 for
 all companies in our sample and estimate aM = 0.17 for the year 2000. Then we

 numerically recalculate all contracts with a2 instead ofUa2. However, we still use
 total risk a2 in order to calculate the costs of options to the company. We do not
 tabulate the results as they are similar to those reported above and none of the
 qualitative results are affected. Ultimately, a completely satisfactory analysis
 of firm-specific and systematic risk must rest on a more complete model that
 explicitly models investments in the stock market. Existing research based on
 numerical examples is consistent with our findings.34

 VI. Interpretations and Extensions

 The results from Section III leave us with the robust conclusion that ob-

 served practice does not conform to the predictions of our model. In this section
 we investigate whether appropriate modifications of our model could generate
 observed contracts as a result of efficient contracting.

 A. Incorporating Taxes

 So far our analysis ignores taxes. The optimal contracts calculated from our
 model suggest that CEOs should receive no options, lower base salaries, and
 more restricted stock. In this subsection we investigate the impact of taxes on
 our analysis. We differentiate between personal and corporate taxes. We also
 carefully distinguish between restricted stock awarded by the company to the
 CEO and unrestricted stock that the CEO either held previously or that she
 bought from her own funds at the beginning of the contract period (t = 0). More
 specifically, we make the following assumptions:35

 Base salary. The fixed component 0 of compensation is paid at time t = 0 and
 is fully taxed at the personal level. For tax purposes it is regarded as a bonus
 and is therefore tax deductible at the corporate level. However, if 4 < 0, then
 neither the company nor the CEO receives a tax credit as we treat this as a
 purchase of unrestricted stock by the CEO.

 Stock option grants. Stock options are exercised at time t = T. At this point
 in time, the gain from exercising the options, PT - K, is taxed at the personal
 level and creates a deductible expense for the company.

 34 See Jenter (2002), Ingersoll (2002), and Cai and Vijh (2005).
 35 The analysis is based on Hall and Liebman (2000). The precise analysis of taxes is somewhat
 tedious. We have prepared a short technical document that reparameterizes our model in order to
 allow for taxes along the lines described in the text. This document is available as a supplement
 to this paper from the Journal of Finance website.

 Restricted stock grants and unrestricted stock. Restricted stock may or
 may not be tax deductible at the corporate level. Tax law allows expensing of
 restricted stock and base salary up to a total of $1 million. Also, restricted stock
 can be expensed if it is awarded as part of a shareholder-approved incentive
 plan. We assume that this is always the case and treat restricted stock as a
 tax deductible expense for the company at the end of the vesting period. At the
 personal level, the CEO defers taxes on the grant until the time when vesting
 lapses, and we assume that this is the end of the contract period, t = T. Then
 she pays taxes on the value PT per share. Unrestricted stock is a purchase by
 the CEO from after-tax income and has no tax consequences other than taxes
 on dividends and capital gains.

 Dividends and capital gains. Dividends are taxed at the personal level at
 the time of payment. We assume that the after-tax dividend is reinvested in
 the company's stock. Capital gains can be deferred indefinitely and are never
 taxed.

 We use a tax rate of 42% for personal taxes and a rate of 35% for corporate

 taxes.

 Table VIII displays the results for the optimal restricted option contract. We
 now obtain larger option holdings compared to the case without tax effects (e.g.,
 for y = 3, n* equals 0.003% in Table II and 0.028% in Table VIII). However,
 while the relative increase is substantial, the absolute increase is marginal.
 The number of contracts with positive option holdings increases from 1.3%
 to 9.6% of all CEOs. The favorable tax treatment of options also reduces the

 benefits to the company from 19.6% of total pay (see Table II, Panel B) to 13.4%
 of total pay. The number of CEOs for whom we cannot verify the validity of
 the first-order approach increases somewhat relative to the case without taxes.
 For realistic levels of risk aversion, this affects less than 10% of our sample.
 We conclude that tax effects explain a small part of the use of stock options
 for a small number of CEOs, but the effect is not nearly sufficient to explain
 observed compensation practice.

 B. Sticky Base Salaries

 A simple way to fix our model would be to introduce a sticky base salary

 constraint. Assume that CEOs' base salaries cannot be reduced below a certain
 threshold value, and that this value coincides with the observed base salary,
 that is we add the constraint 0 > qd to program (16). Then we find immedi-
 ately that all contracts are rationalized as optimal contracts of this modified
 program. To see this, recall that our model trades off a combination of options
 and base salary against stock. Rebalancing the portfolio towards fewer options
 and more stock is feasible only if we can reduce base salaries at the same time,
 as we cannot just shift between stock and options. Mathematically, adding the
 minimum salary constraint leads to a program in which the solution is already
 determined by the constraints, so no further optimization is possible.

 Note that a lower bound on base salaries and the participation constraint
 cannot bind at the same time. A binding downwards constraint on salaries
 therefore implies that the participation constraint (7) is not binding, so that
 the solution is defined by the incentive compatibility constraint (8). If we add
 one stock option to the CEO's compensation package, then this increases com-
 pensation costs by the Black-Scholes value BS and the pay-for-performance
 sensitivity by the option delta N(dl) < 1. Hence, the price per unit of incen-
 tives is BS/N(d1). Because the delta of a share is one and it costs Po, stock
 options are always cheaper in providing incentives as BS/N(d1) < Po. Delta
 may be adjusted to allow for risk aversion and exposure to firm-specific risk.
 This argument is correct if we ask: What is the best form to provide incentives,
 holding base salary constant? In a model like ours in which base salaries can
 vary, the comparison of dollar costs of pay-for-performance sensitivity is irrele-
 vant. Thus, we must compare the CEOs' risk premia for options and for stock.
 This analysis also sheds some light on the small fraction of CEOs with positive
 option holdings that we discover above (1.3% for y = 3; see Tables II and III).
 These CEOs have very little wealth and not all of their option holdings can be
 replaced with stock without violating the constraint that O + Wo > 0.36

 One plausible economic reason for sticky CEO base salaries relates to liquid-
 ity constraints: If the CEO demands some compensation to finance consumption

 36 It seems that the imposition of a more stringent limited liability constraint also explains

 most of the apparent difference between Lambert and Larcker's (2004) results and ours. They
 also make somewhat different parametric assumptions and allow the level of incentives to vary in
 their example. We suspect that loosening the limited liability constraint in their analysis would
 dramatically reduce the optimal option holdings they find.

 today because she cannot borrow against future compensation, then she will
 not accept a contract that offers more deferred compensation in exchange for a
 lower base salary. If this liquidity hypothesis is the correct explanation of the
 usage of stock options, then we should observe more options in the compensa-
 tion packages of those CEOs who have lower wealth, other things being equal.
 Also, CEOs of larger firms should find it more difficult to purchase additional
 stock to provide significant incentives. Table IX investigates if these predictions
 are borne out by the data. The dependent variable is the proportion of options
 in the risk-neutral pay-for-performance sensitivity, defined as

 Proportion of options =

 noN(d1)
 noN(dl) + ns

 Initial wealth and firm size (measured by the log of market capitalization)
 both have a highly significant effect on the proportion of options. As expected,
 the effect of initial wealth is negative and the effect of firm size is positive.
 Even though the slope estimates are highly significant, the economic effects
 are rather small, even after controlling for volatility (see regression (4)). In
 particular, doubling a CEO's wealth decreases the proportion of options in her
 incentive pay by only about 5.9 percentage points. Similarly, doubling the mar-
 ket capitalization of her company increases her proportion of options by about
 4.2 percentage points. Moreover, the adjusted-R2 is only 14% and a large part
 of the variation in the proportion of options remains unexplained. For instance,

 our data set contains some very wealthy CEOs who hold options (e.g., Michael
 Dell), and it seems implausible that they could be liquidity-constrained. Also,
 companies might underwrite a loan and thereby help to overcome liquidity con-
 straints. The liquidity hypothesis therefore remains somewhat unconvincing
 and cannot explain most of the variation in the data.

 We also suspect that liquidity constraints are stronger for younger CEOs

 and those who have joined the company more recently, that is, CEOs exercise
 more options and hold more stock of the company with increasing age and
 tenure. This hypothesis is borne out by the data (see regressions (5) to (7) in
 Table IX), but again, the quantitative impact is small: An increase in tenure
 of one year reduces the proportion of options by 0.7%, so a CEO who has been
 with the firm for 10 years has on average 7% less of her incentive pay in options
 compared to a CEO who has just joined the firm. Table IX is also useful for
 comparing our methodology with regression analysis: All variables in Table IX
 are significant and have the predicted signs. This indicates that the model's
 qualitative implications are correct, even though the quantitative implications
 do not get close to matching the data.

 VII. Discussion and Conclusion

 We analyze executive compensation contracts using a standard, one-period
 principal-agent model of efficient contracting with CRRA utility and lognormal
 distribution of stock prices and estimate it for a sample of 598 CEOs. While our
 assumptions are widely used in the compensation literature, the model yields
 predictions that differ markedly from observed compensation schemes. Gener-
 ally, the model predicts that optimal compensation schemes should have no or at
 best miniscule holdings of stock options, and that incentives should be provided
 through restricted stock. In addition, base salaries should be lower, and many
 CEOs would be required to invest some of their savings into their company's
 stock. By switching from observed contracts to optimal contracts, companies
 could realize economically significant savings. These results are robust to sev-
 eral model variations and extensions. We therefore feel compelled to conclude
 that neither the conventional model nor any of its obvious extensions or modi-
 fications explain the pervasive practice of awarding stock options to CEOs. The
 economic significance of our results may be exaggerated quantitatively by using
 data from the year 2000, which corresponds to a peak in option compensation.37
 We therefore expect that using more recent data would change our numbers;
 however, we expect little impact on our general, qualitative conclusions.

 There are two alternative ways to interpret these results. One possibility
 is to conclude that CEO compensation does not follow the efficient contract-
 ing paradigm and that CEOs use options as a vehicle to extract rents from
 shareholders. This view coincides with the popular argument that options are

 37 The September 2004 issue of Towers Perrin monitor (http://www.towersperrin.com) reported
 that "... run rates have decreased over the past three years as companies have begun to shift their
 equity compensation from primarily stock options to more full-value shares."

 a form of hidden compensation that is not fully perceived by the market, as
 suggested by the resistance of managers to the expensing of employee stock op-
 tions (see Dechow, Hutton, and Sloan (1996)).38,39 Therefore, we also consider
 the hypothesis that potential savings from switching to the optimal contract
 are higher in firms with weak corporate governance. We conduct a rather pre-
 liminary analysis and find mixed support for this hypothesis. We do not report
 our results as this discussion clearly extends beyond the scope of our paper and
 should be the subject of further research. Our main contribution to this litera-
 ture is our savings variable that can be interpreted as a measure of contractual
 inefficiency. If the inefficient contracting view is correct, then our measure of
 contracting inefficiency should be related to measures of effective corporate
 governance.40

 The alternative conclusion is to reject our model and to search for alternative
 models that can better explain observed compensation practice. We consider
 three different model extensions in this paper. While none of them can individ-
 ually explain a substantial part of observed option holdings, they may be part
 of a more complex explanation:

 * Options may be awarded not only to incentivize effort, but also to in-
 vest in risky projects. We show that this argument rules out concave con-
 tracts. Concave contracts lead to even higher savings than the linear "no
 options" contract in our modeling framework, but they severely reduce
 CEOs' investment incentives. On the other hand, the linear "no options"
 contract reduces the incentives to invest only slightly, so this argument
 seems unable to explain why so many compensation packages contain stock
 options.

 * Given taxes favor options, we show that predicted option holdings increase
 markedly when personal and corporate taxes are taken into account. Still,
 predicted and observed option holdings differ by several orders of magni-
 tude.

 * If CEOs are liquidity constrained, then their base salaries cannot decrease
 and observed option holdings are automatically optimal. Our regression re-
 sults provide only limited support for the hypothesis that CEOs are liquid-
 ity constrained. Nevertheless, liquidity constraints might explain observed
 option holdings for a few young and relatively poor CEOs.41

 38 Guay, Kothari, and Sloan (2003) challenge this by arguing that the costs of stock options are

 much larger than could be justified by revealed preferences to report higher earnings.

 39 It is difficult to reconcile the inefficient contracting view with other evidence in the literature.
 See Core, Holthausen, and Larcker (1999), Himmelberg, Hubbard, and Palia (1999), and Bertrand
 and Mullainathan (2000) for evidence on systematic variations between economic variables and
 CEO compensation that corroborates efficient contracting models. Kedia and Mozumdar (2002) and
 Hanlon, Rajgopal, and Shevlin (2003) find evidence for the performance impact of stock options.
 The latter study concludes that there is little evidence for rent extraction.

 40 To facilitate future research on this issue, we provide our savings variable for each CEO for a

 number of years as a supplement to this paper on the Journal of Finance website.

 41 See Kedia and Mozumdar (2002) for the argument that options help to overcome liquidity

 constraints at the firm level.

 Lower Salaries and No Options? 337

 A number of further explanations for the use of stock options have been put

 forward in the literature and might turn out to be successful in aligning the-
 ory and compensation practice. Oyer and Schaefer (2005) suggest that CEOs
 may be overconfident or overly optimistic about the future development of the
 stock of their companies. We replicate their results and find qualitatively very
 similar conclusions, namely, only very moderate increases in option holdings.
 Holmstrom and Ricarti Costa (1986) and Nohel and Todd (2005) consider ca-
 reer concerns, and Jost and Wolff (2003) model preferences based on loss aver-
 sion rather than expected utility. Oyer (2004) analyzes employee retention, and
 Inderst and Miiller (2003) discuss incentives to make optimal liquidation deci-
 sions. Behavioral biases such as valuation errors in capital markets may also
 account for the widespread use of options. Garvey and Milbourn (2002) show, for
 instance, that stock markets underestimate the dilution effect of stock options.
 Adverse selection models possibly explain the use of stock options better than
 the effort aversion approach followed in this paper. For example, Dybvig and
 Zender (1991) show that contracts based on fixed salaries and (restricted) stock
 alone cannot prevent the CEO from making inefficient investment decisions.
 Another avenue for further research may be the explicit consideration of the
 dynamic aspects of contract negotiation. The standard model and its variants
 discussed in this paper are static and as a result any empirical implementation
 ignores the fact that contracts are adjusted every year and that the structure of
 contracts today determines the positions of each party in future negotiations.
 We regard the search for a parsimonious model that explains existing com-
 pensation practice as an important task for future research. This model should
 provide a more satisfactory answer to questions of optimal option design (such
 as reloading, repricing, indexing, or strike prices) that have so far been ana-
 lyzed in the context of a model that is unable to generate optimal contracts with
 options.

 Appendix A: Theoretical Analysis

 A. 1. Solving for the General Contract

 In this appendix we discuss a more general contract that can be written as
 a general pay function 7r(PT), which denotes the compensation the manager
 receives at time T. From (1), PT is distributed lognormal with parameters A(e)
 and a2T, where

 =(e) =ln(Po(e)) + r f - T. (Al)

 It follows that log(PT) = t(e) + uua /T is normal with mean A(e) and standard
 deviation a V/T. We denote the density of PT for a given level of effort e by
 f(PT I e):

 f(PT I e)= 1 exp - [In PT - (e)12 (A2)

 PT/27rTa 2a2T A

 The likelihood ratio is therefore

 df(PT I e)/de In PT - Ii(e)

 f (PT Ie)- a2T

 with g'(e) = Po(e)/Po(e). This maps our model into Holmstr6m's (1979) frame-
 work. Denote the Lagrange multipliers on the participation constraint (PC) and
 the incentive compatibility constraint (IC) by Xpc and Xlc, respectively. Both La-
 grange multipliers need to be positive. Then the optimal contract xr*(PT) for a
 given level of effort e is fully described by Holmstrim's equation (7) adapted to
 our model:

 (Wo exp(rf T) + 7r*(PT))Y = ?PC + XJlcI'(e) - ao + al In PT,

 In PT - g (e)

 a2T

 where:

 SP(e) > 0, co = Xpc - alu(e). (A3)
 S= 2T Po(e)

 Observe that the limited wealth constraint (10) implies that WT > 0 for all
 PT, so the argument of the utility function cannot be negative. Similarly, the
 principal enjoys limited liability and cannot pay a compensation larger than
 the value of the firm itself. Therefore, the constraints on Tr(PT) are42

 - Wo exp(rf T) < xr(PT) < PT.

 However, the right-hand side of (A3) will be negative for PT < exp(-Uo/al). We
 therefore obtain (18), once we require a minimum level of consumption e > 0
 for the CEO. Standard analysis of (18) yields the following results. First, the

 solution n* to the optimal contracting problem is constant at -Woexp(rfT) for
 all prices below PT. At PT = P = exp((EY - ao)/al), the function is not differ-
 entiable; to the right of PT = P, its slope is positive. Moreover, the function is
 convex at PT = P: For any P1, P2 such that P1 < P < P2 and for any a E [0;1],
 we have that ar*(Pi) + (1 - a)7*(P2) > n*(P). Finally, the function is concave
 over the whole interval [P, 00] if y > 1. For y < 1, the r* function is convex if

 PT [P, exp 1y I1,

 and is concave to the right of this interval, with an inflection point that is
 decreasing in y. The optimal contract 7 *(PT) is therefore neither convex nor
 concave.

 A.2. Proof of Proposition 1

 We prove the claim by contradiction. Suppose there is an optimal ef-

 fort level e* < . This effort level would have to satisfy (14), so that

 UPPS(?*, ns, no; y, P(e*)) = k(e*). Note that k(e) is strictly increasing in e,

 as C and P are both increasing, C is convex, and P is concave. However, in this
 case (14) can only be satisfied if

 UPPS(?*, n* no; y, P(e*)) < UPPS(*, n*, n*o; y, P())

 =UPPS (d, n, nd; y, Po),

 which is ruled out by (17). For n < O0, E[U(WT, e)] is a concave function of P, as
 U is concave and WT is then linear in PT. Thus, (17) is always satisfied.

 Appendix B: Construction of the Data Set

 This appendix provides a more detailed discussion of the construction of our

 non-firm wealth variable Wo and the representative option.

 Wealth. Every CEO is assumed to have zero wealth on the date when she
 enters the database. Denote the end of the fiscal year when the CEO enters the

 database by tE, so we assume that WtE_, = 0. Similarly, denote the end of the
 fiscal year we observe and evaluate the contract by to ("today"). Then, for each
 year, we calculate the CEO's net cash inflow as follows:

 Fixed salary (after tax)

 + Dividend income from shares held in own company (after tax)

 + Value of restricted stock granted

 - Personal taxes on restricted stock that vest during the year

 + Net value realized from exercising options (after tax)

 - Cash paid for purchasing additional stock
 = Cash Income.

 Here, fixed salary is defined as the sum of the following five ExecuComp data
 types: Salary, Bonus, Other Annual, All Other Total, and long-term incentive
 pay (LTIP). Following Hall and Liebman (2000), we use the following personal
 tax rates: 31% for 1992, 39.6% for 1993, and 42% from 1994 onward.

 As ExecuComp records only the value but not the number of restricted shares
 granted, we add the value to cash income and deduct the cash needed for pur-
 chasing the change in stockholdings. Similarly, we add the value realized from
 exercising options. Thus, if the CEO exercises n options but does not sell any
 shares and does not receive any restricted stock grants in this period, we add
 the net value realized from exercising the options (i.e., the value of the n shares
 at the time the options were exercised minus the strike price) to cash income
 and deduct n times the market price of the shares at fiscal year-end. Due to
 fluctuations in stock prices, this method will lead to some errors. However,
 there is no alternative to this approach because we do not know the strike price
 of the options exercised. If the CEO sells more shares than she receives from

 restricted grants or exercising options, her stock holdings decrease and the item
 "cash paid for purchasing additional stock" becomes negative. If a CEO changes
 her employer during her history in the database, we assume that she sells all
 unrestricted stock in the old company and exercises all exercisable options for
 which we know the strike price before she is hired by the new company. Re-
 stricted stock and unexercisable options are assumed to be lost. In addition, we
 assume that she buys the shares held in the new company that are not granted
 to her in the first year.

 Denote the cash inflow during fiscal year t by yt. We assume that the CEO
 invests all her surplus cash at the risk-free rate of interest and does not con-
 sume. We assume that all cash inflows are realized at the end of the fiscal year

 and invested at the risk-free rate r+1 during the next fiscal year. We obtain
 data on the annual 1-year risk-free rate rf from the Federal Reserve Board's
 website (http://www.federalreserve.gov). Our estimate for the CEO's (nonstock)
 wealth is then

 to -1 to

 Wo = Yto + yt (1+r ). (B1)

 t=tE s=t+l

 Stock Options. We approximate the options portfolios held by the CEOs at
 the end of the 1999 fiscal year using the algorithm proposed by Core and Guay
 (2002a). We then construct a representative option that summarizes the salient
 features of this option portfolio by creating a composite option that matches
 the value and the option delta of the option portfolio. Denote the number of
 options of type r (with strike price Kt and maturity TT) by nT. Set the number
 of composite options held by the CEO to no = E, no, and denote by BS the
 Black-Scholes value of this option and by N(d1) the option delta. Then the
 maturity T and the strike price K of the composite option can be determined
 by solving the following system of equations for each CEO:

 E nbBS(Po, K', o, rf, 0.7 T') = noBS(Po, K, a, rf, T), (B2)

 'r

 E noN(d') = noN(di). (B3)

 Conditions (B2) and (B3) form a system of two equations in the two unknowns
 K, T, which represent the free parameters of the composite option. We take into
 account the fact that most CEOs exercise their stock options before maturity by
 multiplying T' by 0.7 before calculating the representative option (see Huddart
 and Lang (1996) and Carpenter (1998)). For rf we use the U.S. government bond
 yield with 6-year maturity from January 2000, because the average maturity of
 the representative options is 5.9 years in our sample, as shown in Table I. The
 two remaining parameters (Po, o) are given by the data. Hence, our procedure
 establishes parameters for the options that change neither the value of these
 options to shareholders nor the sensitivity of the option value to the stock price.
 For CEOs who do not have any options, we set K = Po and T = 10 as these are
 the typical values for newly granted options.
