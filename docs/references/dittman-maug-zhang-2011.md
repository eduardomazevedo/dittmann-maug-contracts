We analyze several proposals to restrict CEO compensation and calibrate two mod-
els of executive compensation that describe how ﬁrms would react to diﬀerent types
of restrictions. We ﬁnd that many restrictions would have unintended consequences.
Restrictions on total realized (ex-post) payouts lead to higher average compensation,
higher rewards for mediocre performance, lower risk-taking incentives, and the fact that
some CEOs would be better oﬀ with a restriction than without it. Restrictions on total
ex-ante pay lead to a reduction in the ﬁrm’s demand for CEO talent and eﬀort. Re-
strictions on particular pay components, and especially on cash payouts, can be easily
circumvented. While restrictions on option pay lead to lower risk-taking incentives,
restrictions on incentive pay (stock and options) result in higher risk-taking incentives.

1 Introduction

In this paper, we analyze proposals to restrict CEO compensation. Demands for regu-
lating executive pay are regularly put forward at times of economic crisis when voters
express stronger concerns about inequality and fairness. The ﬁnancial crisis after 2007
is no exception to this rule, and several governments recently considered or even passed
laws to rein in compensation packages deemed to be excessive. We provide an overview
of restrictions currently proposed or enacted in several developed countries and identify
three types of restrictions on executive pay: restrictions on the total level of realized
pay, restrictions on components of pay, such as ﬁxed salary, option pay, or incentive
pay, and restrictions on the ex-ante value of pay.

The objective of our analysis is to investigate the consequences of restrictions on
executive compensation, particularly unintended consequences, and to quantify them.
As such, we conduct a counterfactual analysis of how compensation contracts would
look if restrictions on CEO pay had already been in place. We ﬁt a contracting model to
observed pay, and predict from the model how contracting would change if restrictions
on pay were introduced. Our analysis uncovers a number of indirect consequences of
restrictions on pay that may not be intended by the proponents of these restrictions.
Depending on the type of restriction, risk-taking incentives can substantially decrease
or increase, CEOs can be rewarded more for mediocre performance, and the value of
the ﬁrm can drop when the restriction forces ﬁrms to reduce managerial talent or eﬀort.
We also identify those types of restrictions that ﬁrms can easily circumvent and that
are therefore ineﬀective.

There is a heated and ongoing debate in the literature on whether executive compen-
sation is eﬃcient or not. While some studies produce evidence that observed pay is by
and large eﬃcient, other papers argue that contracting is ineﬃcient and point out pay
arrangements that are diﬃcult to reconcile within the eﬃcient contracting paradigm.1
Our model combines these two aguments. We analyze the eﬀect of restrictions on CEO

1In a highly inﬂuential book, Bebchuk and Fried (2004) argue that executive compensation in
the United States is dysfunctional as managers capture the pay-setting process and use ever more
complex compensation arrangements to camouﬂage the excessive size of their pay packages. See also
Bebchuk and Fried (2003), Bebchuk, Cremers, and Peyer (2007), and Bebchuk, Grinstein, and Peyer
(2009). Kuhnen and Zwiebel (2007) provide an explicit economic model of the pay process that also
incorporates the Bebchuk-Fried notion of “camouﬂage” and “hidden pay,” and Kuhnen and Niessen
(2009) document that public opinion aﬀects executive compensation. On the other hand, Core, Guay,
and Thomas (2005) and Edmans and Gabaix (2009) provide a critical review of Bebchuk and Fried’s
reading of the literature. They argue that many controversial contracting practices as well as general
pay levels can be reconciled with the eﬃcient contracting paradigm.

pay for those ﬁrms where the pay setting process is eﬃcient in the sense of Pareto
eﬃciency. Hence, we allow for the possibility that CEOs are powerful, capture the pay-
setting process, and extract rents, but we assume that they extract rents eﬃciently so
that CEOs and boards maximize the joint value of the ﬁrm to shareholders and to the
CEO. Put diﬀerently, in our model the structure of the contract provides the correct
level of incentives and implements eﬃcient risk-sharing, but the level of pay may reﬂect
some transfer of value from the ﬁrm to the CEO.

We recognize that our argument does not fully capture the perspective of the rent-
extraction view and the potential rationales of the proponents of pay regulation. In
particular, our presumption of eﬃcient rent extraction rules out interventions intended
to address market failures. For example, Acharya and Volpin (2010) model an econ-
omy in which ﬁrms can provide incentives either through compensation contracts or
through improved governance, but ﬁrms do not internalize the fact that opting for
weaker governance and more incentive pay increases CEOs’ outside options and there-
fore the economy-wide level of compensation. Outside interventions may address such
governance externalities and general equilibrium eﬀects, but they are outside the scope
of our analysis, which considers each ﬁrm in isolation.2 Market failures may also result
from turnover costs or from the limited disclosure of executive pay.3 None of these
arguments, however, gives rise to a calibratable model of executive compensation. We
therefore cannot quantify the potential eﬃciency gains from mitigating market failures
through pay restrictions. We partially address this limitation by excluding poorly gov-
erned ﬁrms from our analysis. In these ﬁrms, contracting may not just transfer value
to the CEO but may also be ineﬃcient. Bertrand and Mullainathan (2000a, 2000b,
2001) and Kim and Lu (2009) produce evidence that contracting is eﬃcient for ﬁrms
with good corporate governance and we therefore restrict our analysis to ﬁrms where
contracting is likely to be eﬃcient. More speciﬁcally, we follow Bebchuk, Grinstein,
and Peyer (2009) and require that all members of the compensation committee are
independent directors.

The analysis of the paper has two parts, each of which discusses a model that is

2See also Dicks (2010) for a similar model of governance externalities and general equilibrium eﬀects

in the managerial labor market.

3Limited disclosure is the basis of Bebchuk and Fried’s (2004) argument that CEOs extract rents
through “hidden compensation,” i.e., beneﬁts that are not visible to outside observers and that result
in eﬃciency losses. We know of no satisfying model of hidden compensation and the eﬃciency losses
it entails. Similarly, turnover costs may lead to managerial rents when ﬁrms ﬁnd it diﬃcult to replace
their current CEOs. Taylor (2010) estimates these turnover costs and shows that they are large.

2

tailored to a particular purpose. In the ﬁrst part of the paper, we analyze restrictions
on ex post payouts and on the structure of compensation contracts. We calibrate a
principal-agent model with a loss-averse CEO to each of the 796 CEOs in our data set,
so that the model predicts observed compensation contracts if no restrictions on pay
are imposed. Dittmann, Maug, and Spalt (2010) show that this model can generate
meaningful option holdings, and we extend this result by showing that the model can
be calibrated for most CEOs such that it exactly reproduces stylized observed con-
tracts. When we analyze restrictions with this model, we assume that ﬁrms want to
provide the same eﬀort incentives as before and that externally imposed restrictions on
compensation do not change the balance of power between the board and the CEO.
Consequently, we assume that restrictions on CEO pay do not aﬀect the eﬀort choice
of the CEO or the rents the CEO might obtain. These assumptions are plausible for
restrictions on pay that are externally imposed, for example through legislation.
If
restrictions are imposed by large shareholders, then the bargaining power between the
board and the CEO may also change.

We ﬁrst address restrictions of the total level of realized CEO pay. This rule is based
on the notion that the total payout to the CEO when she leaves the ﬁrm and sells all
her shares and options should not exceed a certain dollar amount in order to avoid pub-
lic outrage. Restrictions of this type are in line with public demands, now enshrined
in legislation in some countries, that boards should “stress test” compensation plans
to avoid ex post high realizations of pay. Since compensation that involves restricted
stock or standard stock options is potentially unlimited, such a cap can be implemented
only with stock appreciation rights or phantom stock that includes a limited upside,
but is otherwise identical to standard securities used to pay executives. Our results
indicate that such a restriction has three, probably unintended consequences. First, on
average, pay increases. If ﬁrms wish to prevent extremely large payouts for extreme
performance, then incentive provision requires more high-powered compensation con-
tracts for mediocre performance and therefore a higher risk-premium. For example, if
ﬁrms limit ex-post pay to three times its expected ex-ante value, average compensation
costs increase by 3.1%, and pay for mediocre performance increases by 14.9%.

Second, in some cases CEOs may be better oﬀ and extract higher rents if pay is
restricted compared to the case where no restrictions are in place. The reason is that
pay restrictions result in more high-powered contracts below the cap. As the downside
of CEO pay is limited due to limited liability, contracts can often be high-powered only
if the CEO earns a rent and is better oﬀ than without a cap. In the above example,

3

8.5% of all CEOs are better oﬀ and on average extract an additional rent worth 13.2%
of their observed pay.

Third, risk-taking incentives decline as restrictions become more severe. Intuitively,
restricted contracts are more concave because of their limited upside. For the observed
contracts in our sample we estimate that CEOs would accept projects that increase
the ﬁrm’s annual standard deviation of stock returns by one percentage point as long
as ﬁrm value increases by at least 0.2%. For restricted contracts this threshold would
increase more than fourfold to 0.9% and we argue that many realistic projects that
have a positive net present value but increase ﬁrm volatility would not be realized if
restrictions on realized compensation were in place. We suspect that this consequence
is also unintended for ﬁrms outside the ﬁnancial industry. For these ﬁrms, concerns
about insuﬃcient entrepreneurial risk-taking incentives seem to be just as legitimate as
concerns about excessive risk-taking.

We then analyze proposals to levy penalty taxes on particular components of pay and
show that even in our highly stylized model, ﬁrms and CEOs have suﬃcient ﬂexibility
to contract around such taxes. Taxes on cash payments (salary and bonus) can be
circumvented entirely at little cost by using more stock and less options, because stock
is more valuable per unit of incentives than options. A tax on option pay can likewise
be circumvented to a large extent by replacing options by more stock while cutting
cash payments. Only a penalty tax on all forms of incentive compensation (stock and
options) cannot be avoided easily. If stock and options are both taxed, ﬁrms will provide
incentives through options only, because their value per unit of incentives is lower than
for stock. As a consequence, risk-taking incentives increase to the point where most
CEOs in our sample would be willing to take on risky projects even if these projects
destroy some ﬁrm value.

In the second part of the paper, we shift our attention to restrictions on the to-
tal value of compensation, which cannot be addressed with a model that holds eﬀort
and talent constant. Faced with a restriction on the value of compensation, ﬁrms must
decide on the optimal way to divide the value of compensation between variable compen-
sation and ﬁxed compensation. Variable compensation creates performance incentives,
but is risky and therefore reduces the value of the contract to the CEO and will in all
likelihood attract less talented CEOs. By contrast, a larger proportion of ﬁxed com-
pensation will make the contract more valuable and therefore potentially attract more
talented CEOs, but will then induce less performance incentives. We therefore develop
a model that is based on a simple production function where CEO talent and eﬀort

4

are the factors of production. We calibrate the model separately for each ﬁrm in our
sample, and analyze the impact of a restriction on total CEO pay on ﬁrm value. Our
model produces higher output elasticities of eﬀort for ﬁrms where incentive provision
is more important, in particular for ﬁrms with higher R&D expenditure. We show in
a model with frictionless managerial labor markets that a realistic cap on the value of
compensation has only a small impact on ﬁrm value: cutting CEO pay by 20% implies
that ﬁrm value declines by 0.07%. In absolute terms, ﬁrm value declines by $0.12 for
each dollar of the 20% cut in compensation.

Several other papers propose models for the executive labor market. Our model is
closest in spirit to Murphy and Zabojnik (2004) and Gabaix and Landier (2008) who
treat talent as a factor in the ﬁrm’s production function. We extend their reasoning
and also include incentive pay as a factor in the production function. To the best
of our knowledge, we are the ﬁrst to estimate the talent-eﬀort trade-oﬀ empirically.4
Our model is much simpler than the models in Edmans, Gabaix, and Landier (2009)
and Sung and Swan (2009), because we do not model the moral hazard problem that
gives rise to incentive pay. The simplicity of our model allows us to calibrate it for an
individual ﬁrm and to generate predictions about the impact of pay restrictions on ﬁrm
value.

There is an emerging literature on pay restrictions. The paper closest to ours is
Llense (2010), who uses an assignment model and also ﬁnds that caps have only a mod-
erate impact on shareholder value. Her model ignores eﬀort choice and does not address
restrictions that also aﬀect the structure of compensation contracts. Garner and Kim
(2010) provide evidence on a regulation in South Korea, where shareholders have to vote
on the maximum amount of compensation that managers can receive. This regulation
is more akin to say-on-pay rules and diﬀerent from restrictions imposed by regulators
or through legislation. Several papers address compensation in the ﬁnancial services
industry in the wake of the ﬁnancial crisis. Bolton, Mehran, and Shapiro (2010) ar-
gue that linking executive pay to debt prices (credit default swaps) would improve (i.e.,
reduce) risk-taking incentives, but that such contracts may not be optimal from the per-
spective of shareholders. Thanassoulis (2010) develops a theoretical argument for caps
on bankers’ bonuses. Cadman, Carter, and Lynch (2010) show that TARP restrictions
on pay deterred ﬁrms from participating in the government-sponsored bailout program
in the US. None of these papers develops a model that incorporates eﬀort choice and

4In contemporaneous research, Edmans and Gabaix (2010) also formulate a model that includes

eﬀort incentives as well as talent and they calibrate their model to ﬁrms in the S&P 500.

none of them addresses the impact of restrictions on realized compensation payments.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The next section discusses the
institutional context and some of the proposals on regulating top executive pay. Section
3 presents our model of optimal compensation. Section 4 describes our data set and
how we calibrate the model to the data. Section 5 analyzes the impact of caps and taxes
on total realized payouts. Section 6 discusses restrictions on individual components of
pay. Section 7 analyzes the impact of restrictions of the value of total compensation on
the value of the ﬁrm, and Section 8 concludes.

2 Proposals on regulating executive pay

The public debate on executive pay. Demands to regulate and restrict top exec-
utive compensation recur, especially in times of economic crisis. Public commentators
demanded curbs on executive pay in the Great Depression, complaining about “corpo-
rations in the red paying excessive salaries” (Sen. Burton Wheeler, 1934).5 At the end,
the US eschewed more radical proposals to legislate against excessive compensation
In particular, companies had to publicly
and relied on market mechanisms instead.
disclose compensation, a requirement that was successively tightened in subsequent re-
forms. Between 1971 and 1973, executive compensation fell under general wage controls
imposed by the Nixon administration to curb inﬂation.6 After 1992, the Clinton ad-
ministration taxed ﬁxed compensation in excess of $1 million that is not performance
related. Finally, the recent ﬁnancial crisis produced a ﬂurry of proposals to reform
executive pay as well as concrete legislative proposals. We group proposals to restrict
executive compensation into three groups, which we discuss in turn: (1) restrictions on
ex post realized compensation, (2) restrictions on the ex ante value of compensation,
and (3) restrictions on speciﬁc components of pay.

Proposals to restrict realized compensation. Realized compensation payments
can be high if a signiﬁcant part of compensation is paid in the form of stock or options.

5One source for the historical debate on executive pay in the U.S. is an unpublished and untitled
note by David Yermack. We are grateful to David Yermack for letting us have this note, from which we
take this citation. He attributes the citation to Sen. Burton Wheeler, quoted by the New York Times
March 5, 1934. See also Dew-Becker (2008) and Wells (2010), who review the history of executive
compensation regulation.

6Crystal (1991) reports that the ﬁrst version of pay controls imposed a 5% cap on all pay increases,
even if executives changed ﬁrms, which reduced turnover. The second version allowed pay increases
only if executives changed ﬁrms, which then increased managerial turnover.

After unusual events, for example a CEO’s departure, a takeover, or extreme changes in
the company’s stock price, shareholders and journalists typically scrutinize the realized
value of the CEO’s compensation. Large realized pay then often receives a lot of
negative news coverage, with claims that these payments are unjustiﬁed. Boards of
directors might therefore want to restrict such high terminal payouts. Politicians may
also attempt to restrict realized pay, but due to legal and constitutional obstacles they
can typically only appeal to the board of directors to implement restrictions. Some
recent examples include:

• The “2009 Executive Compensation Principles” by the Canadian Coalition for
Good Governance stipulate:
“Boards should formally ’stress test’ a number of
possible scenarios to see how their compensation plan will react to future exter-
nal and internal events to ensure that there are no windfalls for unsustainable
performance.”

• In the summer of 2009, the German parliament passed a law on the “Adequacy
of management board compensation,” which includes the requirement that the
supervisory board should provide for the possibility of limiting pay in case of
“exceptional developments.” The law is ambiguous and does not specify what
would qualify as “exceptional”. It imposes a general norm that should be followed
rather than concrete binding restrictions.

• The Dutch Corporate Governance Code, which follows the comply-or-explain
principles, states: "The supervisory board shall determine the level and struc-
ture of the remuneration of the management board members by reference to the
scenario analyses carried out and with due regard for the pay diﬀerentials within
the enterprise." The requirement for scenario analysis indicates that boards should
stress test compensation plans to ensure that “pay diﬀerentials” stay in line with
acceptable norms.

Hence, regulation in Canada, Germany, and The Netherlands all require boards to pay
explicit attention to the design of compensation plans with respect to scenarios that
may lead to large payouts to executives. Boards should “stress-test” compensation plans
and ensure that they avoid “windfalls” and “exceptional developments.”

Legally binding standards may be diﬃcult to implement. In Rogers vs. Hill, the
U.S. Supreme Court ruled that total ex post pay was too high in American Tobacco
in 1933. A shareholder complained against a company by-law that gave 10% of proﬁts

7

above a historical benchmark value to the six top executives of the ﬁrm and argued that
the resulting amounts were too high. The court did not rule against the by-law but still
in favor of the plaintiﬀ when it argued: "But the rule prescribed by it [the by-law; the
authors] cannot, against the protest of a shareholder, be used to justify payments of
sums as salaries so large as in substance and eﬀect to amount to spoliation or waste of
corporate property." This decision was generally seen as an error and did not become
a precedent for subsequent cases.7

Proposals to restrict the value of compensation. There is also a more general
concern with the overall level of executive compensation, and several proposals address
the total value of compensation:

• There are recurring proposals that compensation of top management should not
exceed some multiple of the lowest-paid worker in the ﬁrm. Chrystal (1991)
traces this argument back to Plato, who recommended that this multiple should
not exceed ﬁve. In modern times, J. P. Morgan ordered that CEOs of Morgan
ﬁrms should not be paid more than twenty times the wage of the lowest-paid
worker (see Crystal, 1991, p. 24). Morgan’s policy was endorsed more generally
by Peter Drucker in an essay in 1984.8

• The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, signed into law on Feb. 17, 2009,
limits tax-deductible executive pay to $500,000 for all recipients of any Troubled
Asset Relief Program (TARP) ﬁnancial assistance, including both past and future
recipients under the Capital Purchase Program. The limitation applies to any
compensation that is earned in the current year, even if payment is deferred to a
later tax year.9

• The German Financial Markets Stabilization Act (Finanzmarktstabilisierungs-
gesetz) that became eﬀective on 18 October 2008 empowers the government to

posal is introduced in the U.S. Senate by a democratic senator. Every year it is delegated to a

ﬁnds that TARP recipients experienced negative abnormal stock returns on the days when the re-
strictions were announced.

formulate and enforce restrictions on executive compensation for all ﬁrms that
receive government aid from the stabilization fund. Subsequent government reg-
ulation from 20 October 2008 restricts total annual executive compensation to
500,000 Euro for these ﬁrms. The strict rules on executive compensation are
probably the reason why many ﬁnancial institutions (including Deutsche Bank)
never accepted any money from the stabilization fund.

• BMW announced in October 2009 that they would increase CEO pay at the
same rate as regular workers’ pay in the future. This announcement is probably
intended to reduce public pressure on the company and to win a particular group
of customers.

The “multiple per lowest-paid worker” standard is legally diﬃcult to implement because
it can be avoided easily through outsourcing activities with low-paid workers. The
TARP standard and the German Financial Markets Stabilization Act apply only to a
small, though signiﬁcant, subset of ﬁrms.

Proposals to restrict components of pay. Restrictions on pay components are
popular, because they are often feasible. Over time, particular pay components have
gained or lost popularity with politicians and the general public. Clinton’s one-million-
dollar rule demonstrates that in the 1990s the majority was concerned with high pay
that is not linked to performance; this rule discriminates against ﬁxed salary and re-
stricted stock and made bonus payments and stock options more desirable.10 The
current debate shows that the public is concerned with risk-taking incentives, so they
want to limit incentive pay, in particular option-like pay and bonus payments that are
contingent only on short-term performance. High base salaries that were seen as prob-
lematic in the 1990s do not raise eyebrows in 2009. Severance pay is also often seen as
problematic as it seems to provide a reward for poor performance, and has also been
ruled out by TARP.

3 A model of contracting on CEO pay

We use the contracting model of compensation developed in Dittmann, Maug, and Spalt
(2010) (henceforth DMS), which is a standard principal-agent model with unobservable

10Rose and Wolfram (2002) show that Clinton’s rule had no eﬀect on the growth of executive

compensation or on incentives.

9

eﬀort where managers are loss averse. This model is particularly suitable for our task
because it incorporates options as part of the optimal contract and it is easy to calibrate
to data.11 We sketch the salient features of the model here and provide an intuitive
description. DMS contains a more detailed analysis as well as formal proofs.

In this model, shareholders or the board make a take-it-or-leave-it oﬀer to the CEO
for a wage contract that consists of a ﬁxed salary φ, a number of shares nS, and a
number of options nO with a strike price K. The contract is for a period of T years,
and this time horizon also represents the maturity of the stock options of the CEO.
The wage ˜w of the CEO therefore depends on the end of period stock price as:

˜w = φerf T + nSPT + nO max (PT − K, 0) .

(1)

The end of period stock price PT depends on the CEO’s eﬀort e ∈ [0, ∞) and on a
random variable u, which is distributed standard normal:

PT = P0 (e) exp

rf −

where rf is the riskfree rate of interest, σ is the annualized volatility of log stock returns,
and P0 is the current stock price. Hence, the stock price PT is lognormally distributed
and the log return ln (PT /P0) over T years is distributed normal with mean rf T and
variance σ2T . Our use of the lognormal distribution follows the prior literature (see
Dittmann and Maug (2007) and the references they cite). We have not explored other
distribution models. However, option pricing models that improve on distributional
assumptions typically favor thick-tailed distributions and we conjecture that the impact
of caps on CEO pay would become more pronounced with distributions that have more
probability mass in the upper tail of the distribution.

The managers’ preferences are separable in income and eﬀort and the manager is
loss-averse. We denote the costs of eﬀort by C(e) and assume that these costs are

11DMS show that the optimal contract in the loss aversion model is convex for all realistic levels of
future stock prices. In contrast, in the traditional model with an eﬀort-averse and risk-averse manager,
optimal contracts are always concave (see Dittmann and Maug (2007)). As a consequence, the risk
aversion model cannot explain why shareholders do not voluntarily restrict the high payouts for very
good outcomes that are observed in practice. There are a few other extensions of the risk-aversion
model that can explain option holdings. For instance, Oyer (2004) models options as a device to
retain employees when recontracting is expensive, but neither this model nor several others have been
calibrated to data.

increasing and convex in eﬀort e. The CEO’s payoﬀ is U ( ˜w) − C(e), with

U ( ˜w) =

if
−λ (cid:0)wR − ˜w(cid:1)α if

˜w ≥ wR

˜w < wR

, where 0 < α < 1 and λ > 1.

(3)

This preference speciﬁcation follows Tversky and Kahneman (1992). Here wR denotes
the reference wage and λ is the degree of loss aversion.
If the wage ˜w is above the
reference wage, the CEO regards the diﬀerence to the reference wage ˜w − wR as a gain,
whereas she recognizes a wage below the reference wage as a loss. The loss-aversion
parameter λ > 1 reﬂects the notion that losses have a larger impact on the CEO’s utility
than gains of comparable size. U is concave over gains, but convex over losses. The
parameter α describes the curvature of the payoﬀ function and captures the diminishing
sensitivity of the CEO to gains as gains become larger, and to losses as losses become
larger.12

Given the payoﬀ from the contract, the CEO will choose a certain eﬀort level e. We
assume that, in the initial setting without any restriction on CEO pay, the observed
it implements the optimal (second-best) eﬀort level. Denote

simply with ˜w, then we would obtain the standard, risk-neutral deﬁnition of the pay-
for-performance sensitivity. This is equal to nS + nON (d1) in our case, where N (d1) is
the Black-Scholes option delta.

We introduce restrictions on CEO pay in two diﬀerent ways: First, restrictions can
change the functional form of the contract (1), for instance if we cap ex post realized
payouts from above. Second, restrictions can take the form of a tax and therefore make
contracting more costly and work through the shareholders’ objective function. We
assume that shareholders want to keep the current CEO and to implement the same
eﬀort level as before. Shareholders will therefore choose a new contract (φ∗, n∗

is eligible and that provides the CEO with at least as much utility and eﬀort incentives

where the costs of eﬀort, C(e) drop out of the participation constraint as eﬀort, and
therefore the cost of eﬀort, is held constant. Recall from our discussion in the Intro-
duction that the last assumption does not imply that CEOs are not powerful or that
they cannot extract rents. Rather, we take the value of rents to the CEO as given and
assume that externally imposed restrictions on pay do not change the balance of power
between the CEO and shareholders. Then, whatever level of rents the CEO obtains
under the old contract will carry over to the new contract after restrictions are imposed.
The shareholders’ problem is therefore to minimize expected costs of contracting
E [ ˜w] subject to the two constraints (4) and (5).
In addition, we require that ﬁxed
salary φ, and stock holdings nS, and total wage ˜w are non-negative. Intuitively, we are
looking for a contract that minimizes compensation costs to shareholders, is acceptable
to the CEO, and implements a level of eﬀort not below the one induced by the observed
contract. DMS show that with mild assumptions the contract that solves this optimiza-
tion problem is unique, so the agent indeed chooses the same level of eﬀort under the
new contract.13 For brevity, we shall refer to the optimal contract (φ∗, n∗
O) that is
predicted by the model as the model contract.

S, n∗

The strength of the modeling approach developed in this section is that we do
not need any information about the functional form of the production function P (e)
or the cost function C(e), because the constraints (4) and (5) can both be evaluated
independently of these functions, which we therefore do not need to parameterize.
However, this modeling approach comes with a cost, because it cannot address the
expected value of compensation and does not allow ﬁrms to adjust the level of eﬀort
if pay restrictions make the old eﬀort level too costly to achieve. The second model,
which we analyze in Section 7 below, can address the level of compensation.

13The main condition is that the cost function C(e) of the CEO is suﬃciently convex so that the

overall objective U ( ˜w) − C(e) is globally concave.

4 Data and Calibration of the model

4.1 Data set

We base our analysis on ExecuComp, which contains the details of the compensation
contracts of the 1,500 largest listed U.S. ﬁrms. We select all executives who are CEO
for the whole year 2006, who work for the same ﬁrm in years 2005 and 2006, and who
are not listed as executives of another ﬁrm in 2005 or in 2006.14 This leaves us with
1,407 CEOs. We construct the approximate option portfolio at the end of the 2005
ﬁscal year using the algorithm proposed by Core and Guay (2002) and aggregate this
option portfolio into a representative option as described in Dittmann and Maug (2007).
Eﬀectively, we set the strike price and the maturity of the representative option such
that the representative option has the same value and the same Black-Scholes delta as
the observed portfolio of options. This aggregation of the option portfolio is necessary,
because this portfolio typically contains options with diﬀerent maturities that cannot
be described in a one-period model. In this way, we obtain the number of options, nO,
the option strike price K, and the option maturity T . Likewise, we take the number
of shares held by the CEO, nS, from the end of 2005. Both variables, nS and nO, are
expressed as the proportion of total shares outstanding.

We deﬁne ﬁxed salary φ as the sum of salary, bonus, and “all other compensation”
(e.g. perquisites or insurance premia) from 2006. We include bonus payments, because
prior literature has shown that these payments are only weakly related to stock returns
(see Hall and Liebman, 1998). ExecuComp also provides us with the ﬁrm’s market
capitalization P0 at the end of 2005 and the dividend rate d during 2005. For the
risk-free rate rf , we use the yield of the 5-year U.S. government bond in January 2006.
Next, we use CRSP data to calculate the ﬁrm’s stock return volatility σ from daily
stock returns from ﬁscal year 2006. We lose 26 observations because of insuﬃcient data
for the volatility calculation, and another 54 observations, because our algorithm failed
to ﬁnd a representative option.

Our calibration method is based on the assumption that observed contracts are eﬃ-
cient in the sense that risk-sharing and incentives are optimal. We cannot measure the
eﬃciency of contracting directly and therefore use the independence of the compensa-

14We do not perform our analysis for a more recent year for two reasons. First, we cannot construct
our sample consistently for 2007, because there was a signiﬁcant change in the reporting standard in
2006; some ﬁrms reported according to the new standard while other ﬁrms still used the old standard.
Second, we did not choose 2008 and 2009 to avoid using data from the ﬁnancial crisis.

13

tion committee as a proxy for eﬃcient contracting. We follow Bebchuk, Grinstein, and
Peyer (2009) and require that all members of the compensation committee are inde-
pendent. We match our data with RiskMetrics and delete the 134 CEOs from those
ﬁrms where at least one member of the compensation committee was not independent
in 2005. In this step, we also lose 349 CEOs because of missing data in RiskMetrics.
Table 1 shows descriptive statistics for the remaining sample of 844 CEOs in Panel A.
Since we lose many observations through matching with RiskMetrics we also report the
same statistics before matching in Panel B.

[Insert Table 1 here.]

The table shows that the median CEO owns 0.24% of her ﬁrm’s stock and has op-
tions on another 0.79% of the ﬁrm’s equity. Median ﬁxed salary is $1.03m. Options are
considerably in the money with median moneyness 73.3%, and their median maturity is
4.8 years. Our sample contains large ﬁrms with a median (average) market capitaliza-
tion of $2.636bn ($9.707bn) and a median annualized stock return volatility of 27.4%.
The table also describes the value of the contract π = φ + nSP0 + nOBS, where BS
is the Black-Scholes value of the representative option. The median (average) value of
the contract is $23.6m ($95.6m). Comparison of Panels A and B shows that matching
with RiskMetrics selects in favor of larger, less volatile ﬁrms with higher median con-
tract values. The lower average contract value for the smaller sample can be attributed
to the elimination of some outliers through matching. The structure of compensation
contracts is remarkably similar for the samples before and after matching.

We repeat the entire analysis of the paper for the year 1999, the ﬁrst year for
which membership of the compensation committee is available from RiskMetrics. The
year 1999 is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from 2006, with more volatile ﬁrms, more valuable
compensation contracts, and a compensation structure that leans more towards stock
rather than options. Still, we ﬁnd that all our conclusions hold for 1999 as well (results
not tabulated).

4.2 Calibration of the model

Our strategy is to introduce restrictions on compensation contracts into our model
and to numerically calculate the optimal contract (the “model contract”) under these
restrictions. In the next step, we compare the model contract with the observed contract
in order to describe how contracts would change if the considered restriction could be

14

implemented. This approach is meaningful only if our model predicts the observed
contract for the case without restrictions on pay. We therefore calibrate the CEO’s
reference wage wR such that the observed contract coincides with the model contract
in the absence of any restrictions on CEO pay. This subsection explains in detail how
we perform this step.

Neither prospect theory nor the experimental literature provides us with much guid-
ance regarding the reference wage of the CEO. The main idea is therefore to determine
the reference wage such that the observed contract coincides with the model contract.
For this step we restrict the reference wage to lie within a reasonable range. We proceed
in three steps: First, we solve the model by minimizing expected compensation E [ ˜w]
subject to the incentive compatibility constraint (4) and the participation constraint (5)
(cid:12)
for a given reference wage wR. Then we calculate the distance (cid:12)
(cid:12)n∗
(cid:12) between this
S, nd
O) and the observed contract (φd, nd
model contract (φ∗, n∗
O). Note that accurate
approximation for one parameter implies accurate approximation for all parameters,
because the model has two constraints and optimizes over three parameters. Finally,
(cid:12)
we search for the reference wage wR that minimizes the distance (cid:12)
(cid:12) and require
that this distance does not exceed 10−6. In this way, we identify the reference wage for
which the model contract is identical to the observed contract. We shall refer to this
value for wR that rationalizes the observed contract as the implied reference wage.

(cid:12)n∗

To better compare these implied reference wages across CEOs, we follow DMS and
represent the reference wage as the sum of ﬁxed salary and a proportion 1 − δ of the
market value of stock and options:

wR(δ) = φ + (1 − δ) · M V (nd

S, nd

O).

Here M V represents the market value of the CEO’s stock and options and δ can be
interpreted as the discount the CEO applies to her deferred compensation. If δ = 0,
then there is no discount and the reference wage equals the market value of the CEO’s
compensation in the previous period. If δ = 1, then the discount is 100% and stock
and options do not enter the formation of the reference wage at all so that the reference
wage then equals ﬁxed compensation. We restrict δ to lie within the unit interval,
which implies that the reference wage lies between last year’s ﬁxed compensation and
the market value of all compensation. Table 2 shows descriptive statistics for the implied
reference wages parameterized by the discount δ.

[Insert Table 2 here.]

15

The table shows that for 85.0% (or 717) of the CEOs in our data set, we obtain
two solutions for the reference wage.15 The solution with the higher discount δ has an
average discount of 90%, whereas the discount for the second solution averages 66%.
For 79 CEOs (9.4%), we ﬁnd exactly one solution with an average discount δ of 72%. For
the remaining 48 CEOs (5.7%), there does not exist any reference wage for which the
model can replicate the observed contract. A close inspection of these 48 CEOs shows
that they manage smaller and more volatile ﬁrms, and get almost no stock (results not
tabulated).16

In the remaining part of the paper we therefore work with the subsample of 796
CEOs for which a solution for the implied reference wage exists.
If we obtain two
solutions, we use the solution with the lower value for the discount δ, which seems more
plausible and is also closer to the values we obtain if there is only one solution.
In
unreported results, we repeat our main analysis for the higher value of the discount δ
and ﬁnd very similar results.

5 Restricting total realized compensation

We now ask how the optimal contracts would be diﬀerent if we imposed restrictions on
compensation contracts. The ﬁrst restriction we look at is an ex post restriction, such
that realized compensation cannot exceed a certain threshold. This restriction would
apply to a CEO who leaves her ﬁrm and immediately cashes in all her options and
shares. The resulting high realized payouts might trigger public criticism or outrage,
and the laws in some countries (e.g., Canada, Germany, The Netherlands) have put
compensation committees on notice that they should stress-test their compensation
contracts and avoid excessive payouts.

Legal standards on this question are vague and lack the precision we require for our
modeling purposes. In particular, we need to relate the realized payouts that qualify
as excessive to some measure of average or typical compensation. We use the expected
payout under the observed contract of the CEO, E (cid:2) ˜wd(cid:3), as a benchmark, because this

and 1. Then we identify the intervals in which n∗
minimization within these intervals.

16For one of these 48 CEOs, we ﬁnd a solution with δ < 0. For another CEO, the model contract has
a corner solution at nS = 0 for all δ ∈ [0, 1], so that we cannot identify an implied δ. For the remaining
(cid:12)
46 CEOs, we ﬁnd no solution. In these cases, (cid:12)

this minimum exceeds 10−6.

amount can be regarded as typical and therefore not objectionable for a particular
company. Our model above takes the ﬁrm’s choice of CEO and her eﬀort as given and
therefore cannot say anything about the determinants and the acceptability of average
or expected pay itself. We address such questions in Section 7.

We deﬁne pay as excessive if it exceeds expected pay E (cid:2) ˜wd(cid:3) by more than a pre-
speciﬁed multiple M . More formally, we require that the wage function for the capped
contract, which we denote by ˜wCap, satisﬁes ˜wCap ≤ M ·E (cid:2) ˜wd(cid:3). Note that E (cid:2) ˜wd(cid:3) is the
market value of the entire observed compensation contract that also includes options
and stock granted in previous years or held voluntarily by the CEO. So, if M = 5
and the market value of the CEO’s contract is $20 million, then we only consider wage
functions that never pay out more than $100 million for any realization of the stock
price. The shape of the contract therefore becomes:

˜wCap = M in (cid:8)M · E[ ˜wd], φerf T + nSPT + nO max (PT − K, 0)(cid:9)

= φerf T + nSPT + nO max (PT − K, 0)

The wage function in (6) imposes a ban on all payouts in excess of M ·E (cid:2) ˜wd(cid:3).17 The
capped contract has therefore the shape of a bull spread, which is long in a call option

that
with strike price K, and short in a call with strike price K +
exactly counterbalances the impact of shares and options so that pay cannot increase
above the cap. This structure cannot be implemented with plain vanilla stock options,
but could be implemented with stock appreciation rights and is similar to many bonus
schemes, which also cap maximum payouts (see Healy, 1985, and Murphy, 1999).

M ·E[ ˜wd]−φerf T −nS K

It may not be possible to ﬁnd an optimal contract ˜wCap that satisﬁes the two con-
straints (4) and (5) and the additional constraint ˜wCap ≤ M · E (cid:2) ˜wd(cid:3) if M is too small.
The reason is that M restricts the incentives the contract can provide, so that the incen-
tive compatibility constraint (4) might not be satisﬁed. We calculate the minimum M
for which the model contract can still be found for each CEO. We ﬁnd that the average
minimum M is 2.1 and that the minimum M is smaller than three for 753 CEOs in our
sample (results not tabulated). For these 753 CEOs, we calculate the model contracts

17We assume that the options are in the money when the cap is reached and that the strike price
for the second option in (6) is higher than K, or, more formally: φerf T + nSK < M · E[ (cid:101)wd]. For our
sample φerf T + nSK exceeds E[ (cid:101)wd] for only four CEOs, and then only slightly.

for M = 5 and M = 3 and tabulate the results in Panels A and B in Table 3. Each
panel shows descriptive statistics of the three parameters (ﬁxed salary φ, the number
of shares nS, and the number of options nO) of the model contract with the respective
cap. The table also describes the distribution across CEOs of the change in expected
costs, the change in the CEO’s pay when the stock price at the end of the contracting
period equals the stock price at the beginning of the period, and the probability that
the CEO’s pay increases. Finally, the table displays the proportion of CEOs whose
certainty equivalent CE is higher under the model contract than under the observed
contract and, for the subsample of CEOs where this is the case, the average and median
increase in the CEO’s certainty equivalent.

To provide a graphical representation of our results, Figure 1 displays the observed
contract and three model contracts (M = 5, M = 3, and for the minimum M ) for a
representative CEO.18 The ﬁgure displays total payouts in million dollars as a function
of the stock price expressed as PT /P0. The slope to the left of the lower kink point, which
corresponds to K, represents stock holdings, the slope to the right of this kink point
represents the combined stock and option holdings, and the intercept is the ﬁxed salary.
The higher kink point corresponds to the strike price of the second call option, in which
the CEO has a short position, so that the slope above this point is zero from the cap.
The ﬁgure shows that optimal contracts with restrictions resemble a bull spread, which
approaches a step function as M becomes small. For more severe restrictions (lower M )
option holdings increase, stock holdings decrease, and ﬁxed salaries decline. For the
representative CEO, M cannot be lower than 2.3, that is, for values of M below 2.3 the
optimization problem has no solution, because the incentive compatibility constraint
can no longer be satisﬁed.

[Insert Table 3 here.]

Mediocre performance is rewarded more. One striking feature that is apparent
from Figure 1 as well as from Table 3 is that a restriction on extreme payouts implies
that intermediate payouts are now higher than in the observed contract: Mediocre
performance is rewarded more if large payouts are prohibited. For M = 3, the model
contract pays out more than the observed contract with 55% probability on average

18We choose the CEO whose parameter values are closest to the median values in our sample for
the following parameters: salary φd, stock holdings nd
O, ﬁrm size P0, stock return
volatility σ, time to maturity T , and moneyness K/P0. We deﬁne “closest” as having the smallest
maximum percentage deviation.

Figure 1: Cap on realized compensation. The ﬁgure displays the total payouts
of four diﬀerent contracts for a representative CEO. The solid line shows the payout of
the observed contract while the broken lines show the payouts of three diﬀerent model
contracts where compensation payouts cannot exceed an upper threshold that is deﬁned
as a multiple M of expected pay. M = min is the contract with the smallest multiple
M for which we can ﬁnd a contract that provides the agent with the same utility and
the same pay-for-performance sensitivity as the observed contract. This minimum M
is 2.3 for this CEO. The parameters are φ = $1.1 million, nS = 0.27%, and nO = 1.02%
for the observed contract. P0 is $2.42 billion, K/P0 is 68%, T = 5.8 years, σ = 31.2%,
rf = 4.4%, and d = 0. The implied reference wage is $5.3 million.

(see P rob(∆payout > 0) in Table 3, Panel B), and the payout for an intermediate
stock price PT = P0 increases on average by 14.9% (median: 4.6%, see ∆P ayout at
PT = P0). A cap reduces incentives from high payouts, so ﬁrms must resort to contracts
that are more high-powered for intermediate payouts in order to provide the same eﬀort
incentives as in the observed contract. The lower the cap, the steeper the wage function
has to be for intermediate stock prices. Hence, one - probably unintended - implication
of caps on extreme payouts is that pay for more typical scenarios is higher.

Contracting costs increase. Restricting realized payouts ex post increases the costs
of compensation ex ante. The reason is that contracting becomes less eﬃcient if the con-

19

12345604080120160PT / P0Payoff in T ($ million)  Observed ContractOptimal Contract (M=5)Optimal Contract (M=3)Optimal Contract (M=min)tract has to satisfy an additional constraint. Incentives that were previously provided
through payoﬀs above the cap must be replaced by less eﬃcient incentives with payoﬀs
below the cap. We ﬁnd that the impact of restrictions on costs is small if M = 5, where
costs increase by $50,000 or 0.2% of total compensation costs for the typical CEO (see
∆Expected costs in Table 3, Panel A). However, for tighter restrictions, costs become
more signiﬁcant. The distribution of these costs is also skewed so that, for M = 3,
average costs increase by $2.25 million, but only by $290,000 for the typical CEO. Note
that our analysis provides an upper bound for the costs from adjusting contracts be-
cause our model does not allow for an adjustment of the optimal eﬀort level. Providing
ﬁrms with additional degrees of freedom, which they could use to adjust to restrictions
on compensation contracts might reduce the costs from such restrictions.

Some CEOs are better oﬀ.
In a few cases we ﬁnd that capped contracts are not
only more expensive for the ﬁrm but also more valuable to the CEOs. To provide the
same incentives as the observed contract, the capped contract is much steeper below the
cap. This steepness is achieved by replacing ﬁxed salary and stock with options. Once
ﬁxed salary and the number of shares have been reduced to zero, the CEO earns a rent
if steepness must be increased further to maintain incentives. For M = 3, this happens
for 8.5% of the CEOs (see CE_higher in Panel B of Table 3) who then receive pay that
increases their certainty equivalents on average by 13.2% (see ∆CE|CE_higher=1).
Also, the representative CEO (see Figure 1) earns a rent of 11% if the multiple M is
set to its lowest feasible value (M = min = 2.3). Note that our assumption that the
lower bound on realized payouts is zero is rather extreme. For higher bounds the rents
of CEOs and the number of CEOs who obtain rents would be higher. Hence, another
- and almost surely unintended - consequence of caps on extreme payouts is that some
CEOs are on average better oﬀ.

Risk-taking incentives decline. Restrictions on extreme payouts eliminate the con-
vexity of observed contracts for high stock prices and, in this sense, make the model
contract more concave. As a consequence, CEOs have a stronger inclination to avoid
taking entrepreneurial risks. As a measure of risk avoidance, we use the Risk-Taking
Hurdle (RTH) from Dittmann and Yu (2010):

RT H combines the CEO’s risk aversion and the convexity of her contract. It measures
how the CEO trades oﬀ an increase in ﬁrm risk against an increase in ﬁrm value. It
is deﬁned implicitly from holding the expected value E [U ( ˜w) |P0] of the CEO’s utility
constant. An increase in risk by one percentage point increases the CEO’s utility if and
only if ﬁrm value increases by at least RT H percent.19 We scale this ratio by P0 in
order to express the change in ﬁrm value as a percentage rather than as an absolute
dollar amount.

RT H should be thought of as a hurdle rate. If a project increases ﬁrm risk by ∆σ,
then the CEO accepts this project if the relative increase in ﬁrm value from this project,
∆P0
, is at least RT H × ∆σ. If RT H is positive, the CEO rejects some positive-NPV
P0
projects because they increase risk too much, and if RT H is negative the CEO accepts
some negative-NPV projects that increase ﬁrm risk. Consider a project that results
in a one percentage point increase in ﬁrm risk, for example, from 30% to 31%, and
assume that RT H = 0.5. Then the CEO will not take the project unless it increases
ﬁrm value at least by 0.5%, so she passes up some value-increasing projects. Similarly,
if RT H = −0.5, the CEO will take the project as long as it does not destroy more than
0.5% of ﬁrm value, so she accepts some value-reducing projects. If RT H = 0, the CEO
is indiﬀerent between risk-increasing projects and risk-decreasing projects and always
makes value-maximizing choices.

Table 3, Panel C displays descriptive statistics for RT H, both for the observed
contract and for the model contract with M = 3 and M = 5. In the observed contract,
RT H is positive for 544 CEOs (72% of the subsample considered in the table), which
means that most CEOs are averse to increasing their ﬁrms’ risk and reject projects
that increase risk without a suﬃciently strong increase in ﬁrm value so that ∆P0/P0 <
∆σ × RT H. The average (median) RT H is 0.20 (0.22), which means that the CEO will
adopt a project that increases volatility by one percentage point only if it increases ﬁrm-
value by at least 0.2%. For the median ﬁrm in our sample with market capitalization
of $2,636 million, this corresponds to a value of $5.3 million. When we introduce a cap
in the model contracts, RT H increases for all CEOs in our sample. RT H is positive
for 653 CEOs or 87% of our sample for M = 5, and for 97% of all CEOs in our sample
if M = 3. The average RT H increases substantially from 0.20 in the observed contract

dσ E [U ( ˜w) |P0], scaled by the utility-adjusted delta, d
dP0

19Our measure of risk-taking incentives is eﬀectively the utility-adjusted vega of the compensation
contract, d
E [U ( ˜w)], where the latter is the pay-
for-performance sensitivity we introduced in (4) above. We hold the CEO’s expected payoﬀ constant
and, using these utility-adjusted deﬁnitions, require delta × dP0 + vega × dσ = 0 from the implicit
function theorem. Then (7) follows.

21

to 0.90 in the restricted contract with M = 3. Hence, if the ﬁrm switches from the
observed contract to the model contract, the CEO will also pass up all projects that
generate between 0.2% and 0.9% (or, for the median ﬁrm, between $5.3m and $23.7m)
additional ﬁrm value for each percentage point of additional volatility. These projects
would be accepted under the original contract.
If the ﬁrm has many such marginal
projects, the ﬁrm’s market value can decline considerably. It is unclear whether this
consequence is intended or not.
It probably is intended for CEOs in the ﬁnancial
industry, which has been criticized for excessive risk-taking during the ﬁnancial crisis.
It is less clear that a reduction of risk-taking incentives is also warranted for CEOs of
companies in other sectors. For these CEOs an unintended consequence of restricting
pay may be that restrictions blunt entrepreneurial incentives to accept risky projects
that promise unlikely but large payoﬀs.

Taxes on realized compensation. So far we considered a ban on total realized pay
in this section. An alternative for policy makers is to make undesirable compensation
contracts more costly by introducing special taxes. We therefore also analyze (in unre-
ported results) a tax on realized payouts that exceed a threshold M · E (cid:2) ˜wd(cid:3), and allow
for standard contracts ˜w from (1) that consist of ﬁxed salary, stock, and options. For
this case, we obtain qualitatively similar results to those reported in Table 3, although
the quantitative eﬀect is less stark because a tax is a less stringent restriction than a
cap. If we hold the threshold M constant and increase the tax rate, the ﬁrm replaces
option pay and ﬁxed salary by more stock pay, and option holdings become eventually
negative to approximate the ﬂat region of the payout in the case with a cap (see Fig-
ure 1). However, this result only obtains for suﬃciently high thresholds M , because
the incentive compatibility constraint forces ﬁrms to provide suﬃcient incentives. For a
lower threshold M , ﬁrms might have to use options and pay taxes even it the tax rate is
very high, simply because they otherwise cannot provide the necessary incentives. The
case of a cap above ignores this confounding eﬀect, because ﬁrms that cannot provide
suﬃcient incentives with a given cap simply drop out of the analysis.

6 Restricting components of pay

While the previous section analyzes bans and taxes on payouts above a certain limit,
we turn to taxes on components of pay in this section. We continue to use the stylized
representation of CEO contracts in (1) and analyze taxes on ﬁxed pay (salary plus

22

bonus), taxes on option pay, and taxes on all deferred compensation (options plus
stock).

[Insert Table 4 here.]

Taxes on salary and bonus. For the analysis of a tax on cash payouts, we consider
a 50% tax on ﬁxed compensation that exceeds a certain threshold. A tax of 50% on
compensation corresponds to a loss of tax deductability of 33%, which is close to the
U.S. federal tax rate of 35% on company proﬁts. Note that, in the US, ﬁxed pay above
$1 million is taxed, but eﬀectively this tax is evaded by declaring ﬁxed salary as a bonus.
We therefore ignore the existing $1 million rule and analyze a stricter rule which taxes
all ﬁxed payouts, including bonus payments.

Table 4 shows the results for four diﬀerent levels of the threshold above which ﬁxed
pay incurs this additional penalty tax. We report the three components of the model
contract, the tax that is incurred on the model contract, and the tax that would be
incurred on the observed contract if companies would not adapt their compensation
structure. By adjusting the compensation structure, ﬁrms save the diﬀerence between
these two tax ﬁgures, but they incur an eﬃciency loss, which is the additional con-
tracting cost of the model contract compared to the observed contract when taxes are
ignored. The table also shows this eﬃciency loss.

We ﬁnd that companies respond to a tax on ﬁxed pay by simply shifting compen-
sation away from ﬁxed pay towards more stock and fewer options. For a $1 million
threshold, median stock compensation increases from 0.28% to 0.32% of the outstand-
ing shares, median option compensation declines from 0.77% to 0.74%, and the median
ﬁxed salary declines from $1.03 million to $0.98 million. The logic of these adjustments
is that a share of common stock is approximately equivalent to a certain number of
options plus a ﬁxed payoﬀ. Hence, companies can replace ﬁxed pay by a combination
of additional shares and fewer options, where the exchange ratio between the additional
shares and the reduction of options follows from the incentive compatibility constraint
(4). The number of options to be replaced then depends on the desired reduction in
ﬁxed compensation.

The model contract does not incur any taxes. Hence, the optimal compensation
contract can maintain incentives as well as the CEO’s expected payoﬀ and avoid taxes
entirely for all ﬁrms. The resulting contract is more costly and therefore less eﬃcient
from shareholders’ point of view, but the eﬃciency loss is very small and amounts

23

to about $3,000 for the average CEO and is zero for the median CEO for a $1 million
threshold. The adjustment of the contract leads to slightly higher risk avoidance, RT H,
since options are replaced with stock, and stock makes CEOs more averse to an increase
in ﬁrm risk than options.

[Insert Table 5 here.]

Taxes on option pay. We model a tax on option pay by assuming that the tax would
be imposed on the Black-Scholes value of all option pay. Table 5 shows the results for
ﬁve diﬀerent tax rates between 10% and 100%. For a 50% tax rate, median stock
compensation increases from 0.28% to 0.45% and median option compensation declines
from 0.77% to 0.54%. As options become a more expensive form of compensation,
shareholders maintain incentives with stock rather than with options. Because stock
generates higher payoﬀs for the CEO, the participation constraint then requires that
ﬁxed salaries decline. Table 5 shows that the median ﬁxed salary drops to zero for
all tax rates considered in the table. For more than 50% of the CEOs in our sample
we therefore have a boundary solution, where the restriction that ﬁxed salaries have
to be positive becomes binding. At this point replacing even more options with stock
becomes too expensive because ﬁxed salaries cannot be lowered any further.

Unlike in the previous case with a tax on ﬁxed pay, companies avoid the tax on
options only partially. The reason is that the substitution of options and salaries
for stock stops at the point where ﬁxed salaries become zero and the non-negativity
constraint becomes binding. For a 50% tax, companies avoid on average $1.9 (= $11.1 -
$9.2) million of taxes, but incur an average eﬃciency loss of $0.5m, so total contracting
costs are reduced by only $1.4m relative to the observed contract. For most CEOs the
eﬃciency loss is virtually zero. The average eﬃciency loss increases with the tax rate
as the minority of ﬁrms that faces high eﬃciency costs when replacing options by stock
are nevertheless willing to do so if the tax rate becomes high.

Finally, the hurdle rate RT H for accepting risky projects increases for the model
contracts for any tax rate compared to the observed contract. Median RT H increases
from 0.22 to 0.32.

[Insert Table 6 here.]

Taxes on all deferred compensation. The third case is similar to the previous
case, only that now the tax is levied on stock and options and not just on options.

24

We again consider ﬁve tax rates between 10% and 100% in Table 6. The adaptations
of contracts are the opposite to those in the previous two cases, but they are more
dramatic. For example, if the tax rate is set to 50%, median option holdings increase
from 0.77% to 1.48%, stock holdings decline to zero, and ﬁxed salaries quintuple from
$1.0 million to $5.0 million.

As both forms of incentive pay, stock as well as options, are taxed at the same rate,
taxes cannot be avoided as easily by substituting one form of deferred pay for another.
However, the dollar value of options required to provide one unit of incentives (in our
case, the pay-for-performance sensitivity from (4)) is less than the dollar value of stock
required to provide one unit of incentives. The tax rate per dollar is the same for stock
and for options, so the additional tax burden per unit of incentives is higher for stock
than for options. Intuitively, stock is equivalent to options plus ﬁxed pay, so options
plus ﬁxed pay have one component that is not taxed under this scenario. Therefore,
ﬁrms replace stock by options and ﬁxed salary up to the point where the non-negativity
constraint on stock holdings becomes binding. In this way, ﬁrms can reduce their tax
burden signiﬁcantly. For example, if the tax rate is 50%, net beneﬁts are on average
$15.8 million, which consists of tax savings of $17.0 million (= $49.3m - $32.3m) net of
an eﬃciency loss of $1.2 million.

As options replace stock, risk avoidance decreases and becomes negative for most
companies for all tax rates considered. Therefore, under this tax regime, most CEOs
have an incentive to accept negative NPV projects that increase ﬁrm risk. For a 50%
tax rate, median RT H is -0.16, so the median CEO would be willing to see the ﬁrm
value drop by 0.16% in order to increase ﬁrm risk by one percentage point.

Modeling a more realistic tax system: a robustness check. This section so far
analyzes penalties on components of compensation that work like taxes, even though
we have not explicitly considered taxes so far. This omission may potentially bias our
results, because the tax system may have built-in biases that favor some compensa-
tion instruments over others. The penalty taxes we consider may even be eﬃciency
enhancing if they neutralize the biases of the tax system.

We therefore repeat the analysis in Tables 4 to 6 for a stylized representation of
the U.S. tax system.20 We assume that CEOs pay income tax at a constant rate of
41% (state and federal taxes combined) and that companies can deduct compensation

20The modeling of the tax system follows Dittmann and Maug (2007), who provide a more detailed

discussion (see their section VI.A).

25

expenses from corporate taxes, which they pay at a rate of 35%. Our deﬁnition of
base salary includes all bonus payments. We assume that all these payments accrue
to the CEO at t = 0 and we abstract from the one-million-dollar rule that can be
circumvented when ﬁxed salary is declared as a bonus. Stock options are granted at
t = 0 and exercised at t = T . The CEO pays personal taxes and the company receives
a tax credit at the exercise date of the options on the diﬀerence between the stock price
and the strike price, PT − K. We distinguish between restricted stock and unrestricted
stock. Restricted stock is taxed at the personal level at the vesting date T and ﬁrms
receive a tax credit at that time.21 The CEO also pays personal taxes on dividend
income. We do not consider capital gains taxes that may never be paid when the
shares are never sold.

[Insert Table 7 here.]

Table 7 repeats the analysis in Tables 4 to 6 and reports the key results. For clarity
we shall refer to the additional taxes on particular compensation items as penalty taxes
in order to distinguish them from standard income taxes. For this analysis we do not
recalculate the reference wage for each CEO and use the reference wage for the case
without taxes instead. As a consequence, the model contract for the baseline case does
not correspond to the observed contract as before and we cannot report eﬃciency losses
or gains relative to the observed contract.

The results for the case in which ﬁxed compensation is subject to penalty taxes
(Panel A of Table 7, corresponds to Table 4) are virtually unchanged relative to the
case without income taxes. Base salaries and option holdings are slightly lower, which
means that the substitution of base salaries and options for stock takes places even
more strongly. Similar comments apply to the cases in which only options are subject
to penalty taxes (Panel B of Table 7, corresponds to Table 5) and to the case in which
all deferred compensation is subjected to penalty taxes (Panel C of Table 7, corresponds
to Table 6).

21We maintain this assumption in Panels A and B of Table 7. In Panel C, we do not distinguish
between restricted and unrestricted stock, so that all shares are taxed at time T . The reason is that (in
contrast to Panels A and B) shareholdings decrease in Panel C and restricted stock would otherwise
become negative.

7 Restricting the total value of compensation

In this section, we address a conceptually diﬀerent question: we investigate the implica-
tions of ex ante restrictions on compensation. This is in line with proposals that limit
the total value of compensation, for example as a multiple of the pay of workers in the
same company. The conceptual framework of Sections 5 and 6 is not suitable to address
this question, because it is based on the idea that shareholders have already minimized
the total value of compensation. Hence, a further reduction of total compensation is
possible only if the incentive compatibility constraint or the participation constraint
can be violated.

We formulate a new model where ﬁrms choose the level of incentive pay and thereby
of eﬀort. Here, a new trade-oﬀ arises, because companies now have to decide whether
they want to award a higher level of variable compensation and reduce ﬁxed compensa-
tion. Such a change provides more incentives and elicits a higher eﬀort level, but leads
to a higher risk premium and therefore a lower subjective value of the contract for the
CEO. Contracts with a high level of variable compensation are therefore less attractive
to CEOs, so that ﬁrms will have to compromise on the talent of the CEOs they can
attract. Our model below incorporates this trade-oﬀ between incentive provision and
CEO talent.

7.1 A model of eﬀort and talent

We start with a simple Cobb-Douglas production function and assume that ﬁrm value
is inﬂuenced by the level of eﬀort e and the CEO’s talent t:

V0 = κeβtγ,

(8)

where κ summarizes all other factors that inﬂuence ﬁrm value, and β and γ are elastic-
ities.22 Shareholders have to compensate the CEO for the costs of eﬀort (denoted by
C(e)) and for the costs of bearing idiosyncratic risk (denoted by RP for “risk premium”).
Together, these two components make up the costs of incentive provision, which we ex-
press by IC (i.e., IC = C(e) + RP ). For tractability, we assume an isoelastic supply

22Baker and Hall (2004), Murphy and Zabojnik (2004), and Gabaix and Landier (2008) propose

production functions where talent or eﬀort aﬀect the output linearly.

27

function that relates incentive costs to the level of eﬀort

IC(e) =eη.

(9)

The ﬁrm faces a supply of talent, and we represent the costs of providing talent of
quality t by the isoelastic function23

T C(t) = tδ.

(10)

Since we cannot observe eﬀort e or talent t, the parameters β, γ, η, and δ are not
identiﬁed. In our setup, we cannot distinguish between supply and demand factors. We
therefore substitute (9) and (10) into (8) and rewrite:

V0 = κIC β/ηT C γ/δ = κIC a1T C a2,

(11)

where a1 = β/η and a2 = γ/δ are identiﬁable if we can estimate incentive costs IC and
talent costs T C. Total pay equals π = IC +T C and this amount needs to be paid to the
CEO every year. If the ﬁrm expects to stick to its choice of talent and incentives in all
future years, the expected cost of all future compensation is given by the perpetuity π
r ,
where r is the appropriate discount factor. If the current CEO leaves the ﬁrm, another
CEO with similar talent will be employed at a similar cost. In the absence of a cap on
pay, the ﬁrm therefore maximizes V0 − π
r with respect to IC and T C. The ﬁrst-order
conditions then imply:

IC = a1rV0, T C = a2rV0.

(12)

Next, we investigate the impact of a cap on CEO pay on the value of the ﬁrm. A
cap on CEO pay is simply a restriction so that total expected pay π cannot exceed
some upper limit π. Hence, we require π ≤ π. In the appendix, we prove the following
claim:

Proposition 1 (Value impact of a cap on pay): Let π∗ be the level of expected
CEO compensation in the model without a cap on pay and assume that a binding cap

23Existing models assume that talent in inelastic. In Murphy and Zabojnik (2004) and Sung and
Swan (2009), ﬁrms can choose between two managers only. Gabaix and Landier (2008) focus on the
distribution of talent among the most talented managers. We allow for elastic talent supply, because
arguably talent can be developed and retirement or leisure can be deferred. For simplicity, we treat
talent as a homogeneous good and abstract from the problem that a particular level of talent might
not be available because there are no or too few managers with this particular level of talent.

28

on pay π ≤ π∗ is imposed. Then the log change in value of the ﬁrm with a cap on
compensation, ln(V0(π)/V0(π∗)), can be written as:

ln

(cid:19)

(cid:18) V0(π)
V0(π∗)

= (a1 + a2)ln

(cid:19)

.

(cid:18) π
π∗

(13)

If we assume that the observed level of CEO compensation is the unrestricted optimum

π∗ and the observed ﬁrm value is V0(π∗), we can use (13) in order to estimate the impact
of a cap on CEO pay once we obtain estimates for the sum of the elasticities a1 and a2.
Proposition 1 depends on the arguably strong assumption that a cap on pay induces
ﬁrms to readjust the selection of their CEOs and their compensation practice by moving
along the supply curves for talent and eﬀort. It is conceivable that a cap on pay would
also result in a shift in the supply curve. In particular, if a cap on compensation would
be imposed on an economy-wide basis, such a legislation would also reduce the outside
options of CEOs if they consist in employments as top executives of other ﬁrms.24 We
ignore this aspect here because we have no credible way of calibrating such a shift in
supply functions. Our model therefore portrays a cap that is imposed on an individual
ﬁrm, for example, as a policy of external investors or as a condition for state subsidies
that are available only to a small number of ﬁrms. However, even an economy-wide
ban would probably result in some movement along the supply curve. For example, if a
cap on compensation would aﬀect only publicly listed companies, then talented CEOs
might move to jobs in privately held companies. Alternatively, CEOs might go abroad
or start their own business. It is unlikely that legislative intervention can foreclose all
possible alternatives, so that the decline in value (even if it is somewhat lower than
described by Proposition 1 and by (13)) would persist.

7.2 Calibration and empirical results

In this subsection, we calibrate the model individually for each ﬁrm in our sample and
calculate the reduction in ﬁrm value caused by a cap on ex-ante pay from equation (13).
We then estimate the elasticities a1 and a2 for, respectively, incentive costs and talent
costs in the ﬁrm’s production function (11) and validate these estimates by relating
them to ﬁrm characteristics.

Our empirical results are to a large extent determined by our model assumptions, as
is reﬂected in the fact that we can calibrate the model and generate predictions for an

24See Acharya and Volpin (2010) for an analysis of such general equilibrium eﬀects.

29

individual ﬁrm. An alternative approach that works with weaker assumptions and esti-
mates the model across a number of ﬁrm (e.g., from the same industry) fails, however.
The reason is that by assumption, ﬁrms have optimized CEO compensation, so that
any cross-sectional variation in the relation between ﬁrm value and CEO compensation
can only come from ﬁrm heterogeneity (see, e.g., Himmelberg, Hubbard, and Palia,
1999). Hence, any approach that gives more power to the data fails because we do not
observe out-of-equilibrium outcomes.

To estimate the reduction in ﬁrm value from (13) we need an estimate of a1 + a2.
As π = IC + T C, the ﬁrst-order conditions (12) imply that a1 + a2 = π
. For the
rV0
costs of the contract π, we use total compensation (TDC1 from ExecuComp) from
2006.25 As V0 denotes the gross ﬁrm value before the deduction of wage payments to
the CEO, we set V0 equal to the sum of the ﬁrm’s market capitalization at the end
of 2005, the ﬁrm’s total debt at the end of 2005, and the present value of all future
CEO compensation which we estimate by total compensation in 2006 divided by the
risk-free rate r = 4.35%. We delete 74 CEOs from our sample who hold more than 5%
of the shares of their ﬁrms, because these CEOs are likely to be owner-managers rather
than salaried agents. We lose another 33 CEOs because we do not have enough data
to construct the ﬁrm value V0.

[Insert Table 8 here.]

Table 8, Panel A displays the results of our calibration for the full sample and
separately for each of the 12 Fama-French industries. The last two columns show the
loss in ﬁrm value when CEO pay is reduced by 20%. The ﬁrst of these two columns
displays the gross change in ﬁrm value from (13), while the second column shows the
change in ﬁrm value net of CEO pay. For the purpose of this calculation, we deﬁne
ﬁrm value as net ﬁrm value, which equals V0(π) − π/r and report the decline in value
as a percentage change, not as a logarithmic change as in (13). The average loss across
all ﬁrms in our sample is 0.64% in gross terms and 0.07% net of CEO pay. Hence,
approximately (0.64% − 0.07%)V0 comes from the 20% reduction in CEO pay. The
(cid:101)wd(cid:1) from (1) because the observed
contract (cid:101)wd might contain large unrestricted stock holdings that the CEO cannot reasonably expect to
receive during each contracting period of length T . Many CEOs own a considerable amount of shares
in their own ﬁrm, either because they were founders of the ﬁrm or because they are required to do
so by shareholders. These stock holdings are not a compensation cost to the ﬁrm as they were given
to the CEO or acquired by the CEO in the past. Nevertheless, these stock holdings enter the risk
premium RP . The ﬁrm need not pay for these shareholdings, but it must compensate the CEO for
the disutility of holding on to them.

25We do not use the expected value of the observed contract E (cid:0)

30

average gross ﬁrm value therefore declines by
in compensation, which results in a net loss of $0.12.

0.64%V0
(0.64%−0.07%)V0

= $1.12 for each dollar cut

For the separate estimation of a1 and a2 we need estimates of incentive costs IC
and talent costs T C.
Incentive costs are the sum of the costs of eﬀort and the risk
premium (IC = C(e) + RP ). We obtain the risk premium over the whole contracting
period, RP · T , from the model in Section 5 as the diﬀerence between the market value
of the contract and the certainty equivalent of the contract for the CEO. We divide this
risk premium RP · T by the length of the contracting period, T , over which the risk
premium is measured in order to arrive at an annual value, RP . As the costs of eﬀort
are unobservable, we assume that these costs are proportional to the risk premium,
so that C(e) = ξRP and consequently IC = (1 + ξ)RP . We repeat our analysis for
diﬀerent values of ξ to demonstrate that our results are robust. The talent costs are
then given by T C = π − IC.

Panel A of Table 8 also shows the average estimates of the elasticities a1 and a2,
where we assume ξ = 0.5, i.e. costs of eﬀort are 50% of the risk premium. The choice
of ξ aﬀects our results in two respects. First, the relative importance of incentives and
talent depends on ξ. For ξ = 0.5, incentives appear less important for value creation
than talent, because the average a1 is considerably smaller than the average a2. As
ξ increases, however, the diﬀerence between a2 and a1 shrinks and eventually changes
sign. The second eﬀect of ξ is that talent costs become negative for some CEOs, because
total pay π is smaller than (1+ξ) times the risk premium RP . For ξ = 0.5 this happens
for 41 ﬁrms. We keep these ﬁrms in Table 8, because we do not want to introduce a bias
in our cross-sectional results. If we assume that ξ is of similar size across industries,
the diﬀerences in our estimates across industries are independent of the actual size of
ξ. Table 8, Panel A then shows that eﬀort is most important for consumer durables
and business equipment and least important for utilities, and chemicals. On the other
hand, talent is most important for consumer durables and chemicals, while it is least
important for telephone/television, utilities, and ﬁnance.

We expect that incentive pay is more important (i.e., the elasticity a1 is higher) in
ﬁrms where the CEO has more discretion and agency problems are stronger. In Table
8, Panel B, we therefore split our sample into two groups according to the median of a1.
Here, we exclude the ﬁnancial industry since their balance sheets are diﬃcult to compare
to those of industrial ﬁrms. For both groups, the group with above median values of
a1 and the group with below median values of a1, we report the means of several
ﬁrm characteristics and test whether these diﬀerences are signiﬁcant. We consider

31

tangibility, R&D expenses, and advertising expenses, all scaled by total assets. We also
include the mean pay-for-performance sensitivity in each industry, once in dollar-dollar
terms and once in dollar-% terms. The latter variable measures the dollar increase
in CEO wealth for a percentage increase in ﬁrm value. Moreover, we estimate excess
pay following the approach of Core, Holthausen, and Larcker (1999): we regress total
compensation (ExecuComp item TDC1) on sales, a ﬁve-year average of the market-
to-book ratio, return on assets, the standard deviation of the return on assets, the
stock market return, and the standard deviation of the stock market return. Standard
deviations are also calculated over ﬁve years. Excess pay is then the residual from this
regression.

Table 8, Panel B shows that asset tangibility is lower by 2.3%, R&D expenditures
are higher by 1.2%, and advertising expenses are higher by 0.4% for the ﬁrms where
our estimate of the eﬀort elasticity a1 is above the median. These diﬀerences are
statistically signiﬁcant only for the R&D expenditures. These ﬁndings are consistent
with our hypothesis that incentives play a larger role in industries where managers have
more discretion and where agency problems are larger. We also ﬁnd that the pay-for-
performance sensitivity (if expressed in $-$ terms) is signiﬁcantly higher for ﬁrms with
high a1 estimate. This ﬁnding is not surprising, because a1 is by construction high
when the risk-premium is high.

The right part of Table 8, Panel B displays a similar sample split with respect to the
coeﬃcient a2 on talent. It shows that this parameter cannot be related to any of the
ﬁrm characteristics shown in the table. Interestingly, our estimate for the importance
of talent is also not signiﬁcantly associated with excess pay. There is a debate in the
literature whether excess pay is a measure of rent extraction (e.g., Core, Holthausen,
If excess pay is a
and Larcker, 1999) or of managerial talent (e.g., Falato, 2007).
measure of talent, ﬁrms where talent is important should employ more talented CEOs
and give them more excess pay, i.e., a2 should be positively related to excess pay. We
do ﬁnd a positive sign, but the diﬀerence is insigniﬁcant. Altogether, our results for
the coeﬃcients a1 and a2 suggest that the model captures the relationship between
compensation and ﬁrm value in a sensible way.

32

8 Discussion and conclusion

In this paper we discuss restrictions on executive pay and analyze three types of restric-
tions that have been advocated recently: restrictions on ex post realized pay in order
to avoid large payouts to executives across a range of possible scenarios, restrictions on
components of pay, and, ﬁnally, restrictions on the ex ante value of pay.

The impact of restrictions on realized pay is mostly small, but these restrictions
have some unintended consequences: CEOs earn on average more, they are rewarded
more for mediocre performance, and they become generally more averse to accepting
additional risks. Restrictions on individual components of pay have almost no impact
at all because companies can contract around these restrictions at no or little cost. In
both cases, the impact on ﬁrm value is small because ﬁrms can still hire the same CEO
and implement the same level of incentives as before, unless restrictions on realized pay
become too stringent.

Regulating the ex ante value of pay in order to limit compensation when it is deemed
to be excessively high is potentially more costly. In this case ﬁrms cannot simultaneously
provide the same level of incentives and attract executives of the same quality as before.
We therefore develop a simple model that features compensation to provide incentives
as well as compensation for talent. Consistent with our intuition we ﬁnd that eﬀort
provision has a bigger impact on ﬁrm value when agency problems are likely, i.e., in
industries with more intangible assets and more R&D. However, the model implies
only an average 0.07% loss in ﬁrm value if ﬁrms are forced to reduce total CEO pay
by 20%. The reason is that the model does not incorporate frictions in the market
for managerial labor and assumes a signiﬁcant degree of substitution between talent
and eﬀort, which provides ﬁrms with a lot of leeway to evade restrictions. Our model
has this feature in common with other models of the executive labor market (e.g.,
Gabaix and Landier, 2008; Edmans and Gabaix, 2010) and we conjecture that models
that would include more frictions would give rise to higher estimates of the costs of
restricting compensation.

Throughout the paper we maintain the working hypothesis that observed compen-
sation practice is Pareto eﬃcient and we therefore work with a sample of ﬁrms where
all directors on the compensation committee are independent. A stronger indication of
eﬃcient contracting is that one of the directors on the compensation committee holds
an equity stake of at least 1% and is not an employee of the ﬁrm. There are 59 ﬁrms
in our sample that qualify as “good corporate governance” according to this indicator.

33

In unreported work, we repeat our analysis from Sections 5 and 6 separately for this
subsample, but none of our results changes much.

Our analysis does not cover the potential eﬃciency gains from pay restrictions,
mainly because they seem to be impossible to quantify. Theoretical research on gover-
nance externalities, turnover costs, or hidden compensation is in its infancy and existing
models do not lend themselves to calibration and the quantiﬁcation of eﬀects (see our
discussion in the Introduction). We can only speculate that these defects of the manage-
rial labor market would be better addressed through improvements of the pay-setting
process and the managerial labor market such as better disclosure rules and improved
governance, rather than through pay restrictions. More theoretical work is needed here.
We restrict our analysis to a discussion of ﬁrm value. Restrictions on compensation
may have other consequences. For example, capping CEO pay may increase the utility
of voters who are inequality averse and reduced risk-taking incentives may also beneﬁt
workers. While these issues may be important for the political process and for the
motivations of capping CEO pay, they are beyond the scope of this paper.

Appendix: Proof of Proposition 1

In the presence of a cap, the ﬁrm maximizes V0 − π
subject to
the constraint π ≤ π. We assume that the restriction is binding, that is, that π < π∗.
The ﬁrst-order conditions then are:

r = κIC a1T C a2 − IC+T C

where λ is the Lagrange multiplier associated with the constraint π ≤ ¯π. Together with
π = IC + T C, we obtain

π = (a1 + a2)

⇒ IC =

V0

Under a binding cap, we therefore have IC(¯π) = a1
¯π. In the
case without a cap, we obtain similar expressions (this is the case where the restriction
is not binding, so that λ = 0.): IC(π∗) = a1
π∗. We therefore
obtain:

π∗, and T C(π∗) = a2

Table 3: Contracts with a cap on realized compensation

This  table  describes  optimal  contracts  that  are  capped  at  M  times  the  expected  value  of  the  observed
contract, for two values of M (M = 3 in Panel A, and M = 5 in Panel B). The table shows the results for the
subsample of 753 executives where the contracting problem can be solved for M = 3. ΔExpected cost is the
difference in the expected costs between model contract and observed contract, once expressed in million
dollars and once expressed as a percentage of total pay π. ΔPayout at Pt = P0 is the difference in the payout
for the stock price Pt = P0 between model contract and observed contract, once expressed in million dollars
and once expressed as a percentage. Prob(Δpayout > 0) is the probability that the model contract pays out
more  than  the  observed  contract.  CE_higher  is  a  dummy  variable  that  indicates  whether  the  certainty
equivalent from the model contract is higher than that from the observed contract. ΔCE (%) | CE_higher=1
is  the  difference  in  certainty  equivalents  between  model  contract  and  observed  contract  given  that  this
difference  is  positive.  Panel  C  shows  the  risk-taking  hurdle  (RTH  from  equation  (7))  for  the  observed
contract and the two model contracts, and the changes in RTH for the two model contracts relative to the
observed contract. RTH is a measure of the CEO’s inclination to avoid taking on additional risk.

This table shows the results for a 50% tax on fixed compensation for four different levels of the threshold above which fixed pay incurs this penalty tax. The table
shows  the  mean  and  median  of  the  three  contract  parameters,  the  taxes  incurred  on  the  observed  and  the  model  contract,  and  the  efficiency  loss,  which  is  the
difference in contracting costs between model contract and observed contract in the absence of taxes. RTH, the risk-taking hurdle from equation (7), is a measure of
the CEO’s inclination to avoid taking on additional risk. This table shows the results for the 796 CEOs for whom we can find an implied reference wage (see Table 2).

Table 7: Robustness check with taxes

This table shows robustness checks of Tables 4 to 6 when we introduce realistic taxes both at the company
level and at the personal level. We use the implied reference wage from the non-tax world (higher discount
from Table 2) and calculate the optimal contract with realistic taxes. The resulting contract is shown in the
first line of each table. Panel A shows optimal contracts for 709 CEOs when - in addition to the baseline
taxes - fixed salary is not any longer tax deductible above the threshold displayed in the first column. Panel
B shows optimal contracts for 699 CEOs when - in addition to the baseline taxes - option pay is taxed with
the tax rate displayed in the first column. Finally, Panel C shows optimal contracts for 748 CEOs when - in
addition to the baseline taxes - option and stock pay is taxed with the tax rate displayed in the first column.
For the baseline tax case in Panels A and B, we assume that unrestricted stock is not an expense to the firm
and, accordingly, not tax deductible. For consistency reasons (see Footnote XXX), we assume in Panel C
that all equity pay is tax deductible.

Table 8: The effect of talent and effort on firm value

Panel  A  shows  average  estimates  of  the  coefficients  a1  and  a2  of  the  production  function  (11)  for  the
complete sample of 689 CEOs and separately for the twelve Fama-French industries in our sample. We lose
107 observations, because of data requirements and because we drop those CEOs who are owner-managers,
i.e., their shareholdings nS exceed 5%. The rightmost two columns in Panel A show the average estimated
change  in  firm  value ΔV  when  total  CEO  pay  is  reduced  by  20%.  The  second-to-last  column  shows  the
gross change in firm value from Proposition 1. The last column shows the change in firm value net of CEO
pay, where firm value equals V0() –  / r and the decline in value is reported as a percentage change rather
than a logarithmic change as in Proposition 1. The estimates for a1 and a2 – but not those for ΔV – depend
on the assumption that ξ = 0.5. Panel B shows the average of six firm characteristics for subsamples formed
according to the size of our estimates for a1 and, respectively, a2. Here, the subgroup ‘High’ (‘Low’) refers
to the firms with above median (below median) value for the considered coefficient. We exclude financial
firms from our analysis in Panel B. The table also shows the p-value of the two-sample t-test. Tangibility
refers  to  tangible  assets  and  is  expressed  as  a  percentage  of  total  assets,  just  like  R&D  expense  and
Advertising  expense.  PPS  $-$  is  the  pay-for-performance  sensitivity  that  measures  by  how  many  dollars
CEO wealth increases if firm value increases by $1. PPS $-% measures by how many dollars CEO wealth
increases  if  firm  increases  by  1%.  Excess  pay  is  the  residual  from  a  regression  of  total  CEO  pay  on
previous year’s sales, investment opportunities, ROA, stock return, and the standard deviations of ROA and
stock returns over the past five years (see Core, Holthausen & Larcker (1999)).
